      "{'question': 'Who was President when the first Peanuts cartoon was published?', 'question_id': 'tc_0', 'question_source': 'http://www.triviacountry.com/', 'entity_pages': {'doc_source': ['TagMe'], 'filename': ['Peanuts.txt'], 'title': ['Peanuts'], 'wiki_context': ['Peanuts is a syndicated daily and Sunday American comic strip written and illustrated by Charles M. Schulz, which ran from October 2, 1950, to February 13, 2000, continuing in reruns afterward. The strip is the most popular and influential in the history of comic strips, with 17,897 strips published in all, making it \"arguably the longest story ever told by one human being\".  At its peak, Peanuts ran in over 2,600 newspapers, with a readership of 355 million in 75 countries, and was translated into 21 languages.  It helped to cement the four-panel gag strip as the standard in the United States,  and together with its merchandise earned Schulz more than $1 billion. Reprints of the strip are still syndicated and run in almost every U.S. newspaper.\\n\\nThe strip focuses entirely on a miniature society of young children, with no shown adult characters. The main character, Charlie Brown, is meek, nervous, and lacks self-confidence. He is unable to fly a kite, win a baseball game, or kick a football. \\n\\nPeanuts is one of the literate strips with philosophical, psychological, and sociological overtones that flourished in the 1950s.  The strip\\'s humor (at least during its \\'60s peak) is psychologically complex, and the characters\\' interactions formed a tangle of relationships that drove the strip.\\n\\nPeanuts achieved considerable success with its television specials, several of which, including A Charlie Brown Christmas  and It\\'s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,  won or were nominated for Emmy Awards. The holiday specials remain popular and are currently broadcast on ABC in the U.S. during the corresponding seasons. The Peanuts franchise met acclaim in theatre, with the stage musical You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown being a successful and often-performed production.\\n\\nIn 2013, TV Guide ranked the Peanuts television specials the fourth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.  A computer-animated feature film based on the strip, The Peanuts Movie, was released on November 6, 2015.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n1940s\\n\\nPeanuts had its origin in Li\\'l Folks, a weekly panel comic that appeared in Schulz\\'s hometown paper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, from 1947 to 1950. He first used the name Charlie Brown for a character there, although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys and one buried in sand. The series also had a dog that looked much like the early 1950s version of Snoopy.  In 1948, Schulz sold a cartoon to The Saturday Evening Post which published 17 single-panel cartoons by Schulz. The first of these was of a boy sitting with his feet on an ottoman.\\n\\nIn 1948, Schulz tried to have Li\\'l Folks syndicated through the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a firm run by the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain. Schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but the deal fell through. Li\\'l Folks was dropped in early 1950. Later that year, Schulz approached the United Feature Syndicate - also operated by Scripps-Howard - with his best work from Li\\'l Folks. When his work was picked up by United Feature Syndicate, they decided to run the new comic strip he had been working on. This strip was similar in spirit to the panel comic, but it had a set cast of characters, rather than different nameless little folk for each page. The name Li\\'l Folks was too close to the names of two other comics of the time: Al Capp\\'s Li\\'l Abner and a strip titled Little Folks. To avoid confusion, the syndicate settled on the name Peanuts, after the peanut gallery featured in the Howdy Doody TV show. \\n\\nPeanuts was a title Schulz always disliked. In a 1987 interview, Schulz said of the title Peanuts: \"It\\'s totally ridiculous, has no meaning, is simply confusing, and has no dignity—and I think my humor has dignity.\"  The periodic collections of the strips in paperback book form typically had either \"Charlie Brown\" or \"Snoopy\" in the title, not \"Peanuts\", because of Schulz\\' distaste for his strip\\'s title. From November 20, 1966 to January 4, 1987, the opening Sunday panels typically read Peanuts, featuring Good Ol\\' Charlie Brown.\\n\\n1950s\\n\\nPeanuts premiered on October 2, 1950, in nine newspapers: The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, The Minneapolis Tribune, The Allentown Morning Call, The Bethlehem Globe-Times, The Denver Post, The Seattle Times, The New York World-Telegram & Sun, and The Boston Globe. It began as a daily strip. The first strip was four panels long and showed Charlie Brown walking by two other young children, Shermy and Patty. Shermy lauds Charlie Brown as he walks by, but then tells Patty how he hates him in the final panel. This was groundbreaking. Until then, rarely had children expressed hatred for others in comic strips. Snoopy was also an early character in the strip, first appearing in the third strip, which ran on October 4. Its first Sunday strip appeared January 6, 1952, in the half-page format, which was the only complete format for the entire life of the Sunday strip. Most of the other characters that eventually became the main characters of Peanuts did not appear until later: Violet (February 1951), Schroeder (May 1951), Lucy (March 1952), Linus (September 1952), Pig-Pen (July 1954), Sally (August 1959), Frieda (March 1961), \"Peppermint\" Patty (August 1966), Woodstock (introduced April 1967; given a name in June 1970), Franklin (July 1968), Marcie (July 1971), and Rerun (March 1973).\\n\\nSchulz decided to produce all aspects of the strip himself from the script to the finished art and lettering. (Schulz did, however, hire help to produce the comic book adaptations of Peanuts.)  Thus, the strip was able to be presented with a unified tone, and Schulz was able to employ a minimalistic style. Backgrounds were generally not used, and when they were, Schulz\\'s frazzled lines imbued them with a fraught, psychological appearance. This style has been described by art critic John Carlin as forcing \"its readers to focus on subtle nuances rather than broad actions or sharp transitions.\"  Schulz held this belief all his life, reaffirming in 1994 the importance of crafting the strip himself: \"This is not a crazy business about slinging ink. This is a deadly serious business.\" \\n\\nWhile the strip in its early years resembles its later form, there are significant differences. The art was cleaner, sleeker, and simpler, with thicker lines and short, squat characters. For example, in these early strips, Charlie Brown\\'s famous round head is closer to the shape of an American football or rugby football. Most of the kids were initially fairly round-headed. As another example, all the characters (except Charlie Brown) had their mouths longer and had smaller eyes when they looked sideways. \\n\\n1960s–1970s\\n\\nThe 1960s is known as the \"golden age\" for Peanuts. During this period some of the most well known themes and characters appeared, including: Peppermint Patty,  Snoopy as the \"World War One Flying Ace\",  Frieda and her \"naturally curly hair\",  and Franklin.  Peanuts is remarkable for its deft social commentary, especially compared with other strips appearing in the 1950s and early 1960s. Schulz did not explicitly address racial and gender equality issues so much as he assumed them to be self-evident in the first place. Peppermint Patty\\'s athletic skill and self-confidence is simply taken for granted, for example, as is Franklin\\'s presence in a racially integrated school and neighborhood. (Franklin came about at least in part as a result of Schulz\\'s correspondence in 1968 with a socially progressive fan.Evon, Dan (December 24, 2015). [http://www.snopes.com/charlie-brown-racist-franklin/ \"You\\'re a Racist, Charlie Brown?: A closer look at allegations of racism in the comic strip \\'Peanuts\\'\"]. Snopes.com.) The fact that Charlie Brown\\'s baseball team had three girls was also at least ten years ahead of its time (and in fact, the TV special Charlie Brown\\'s All-Stars dealt with Charlie Brown refusing sponsorship of the team because the sponsor said the league does not allow girls or dogs to play).\\n\\nSchulz would throw satirical barbs at any number of topics when he chose. Over the years he tackled everything from the Vietnam War to school dress codes to the \"New math.\" One strip on May 20, 1962 even had an icon that stated \"Defend Freedom, Buy US Savings Bonds.\"  In 1963 he added a little boy named \"5\" to the cast,  whose sisters were named \"3\" and \"4,\"  and whose father had changed their family name to their ZIP Code, giving in to the way numbers were taking over people\\'s identities. In 1958, a strip in which Snoopy tossed Linus into the air and boasted that he was the first dog ever to launch a human, parodied the hype associated with Sputnik 2\\'s launch of \"Laika\" the dog into space earlier that year. Another sequence lampooned Little Leagues and \"organized\" play, when all the neighborhood kids join snowman-building leagues and criticize Charlie Brown when he insists on building his own snowmen without leagues or coaches.\\n\\nDuring the week of July 29, 1968, Schulz debuted the African-American character Franklin to the strip, at the urging of white Los Angeles schoolteacher Harriet Glickman. Though Schulz feared that adding a black character would be seen as patronizing to the African-American community, Glickman convinced him that the addition of black characters could help normalize the idea of friendships between children of different ethnicities. Franklin appeared in a trio of strips set at a beach, in which he first greets Charlie Brown\\'s beach ball from the water and subsequently helps him build a sand castle, during which he mentions that his father is in Vietnam. He never occupies the same panel, however, with the Caucasian Sally.\\n\\nPeanuts touched on religious themes on many occasions, most notably the classic television special A Charlie Brown Christmas in 1965, which features the character Linus van Pelt quoting the King James Version of the Bible (Luke 2:8–14) to explain to Charlie Brown what Christmas is all about (in personal interviews, Schulz mentioned that Linus represented his spiritual side). Because of the explicit religious material in A Charlie Brown Christmas, many have interpreted Schulz\\' work as having a distinct Christian theme, though the popular perspective has been to view the franchise through a secular lens. \\n\\nIn the late 1970s, during Schulz\\' negotiations with United Feature Syndicate over a new contract, syndicate president William C. Payette hired comics artist Al Plastino to draw a backlog of Peanuts strips to hold in reserve in case Schulz left the strip. When Schulz and the syndicate reached a successful agreement, United Media stored these unpublished strips, the existence of which eventually became public. \\n\\n1980s–1990s\\n\\nThough Garfield and Calvin and Hobbes rivaled Peanuts in popularity in the 1980s and the 1990s respectively, the strip still remained the most popular comic in history. \\n\\nThe daily Peanuts strips were formatted in a four-panel \"space saving\" format beginning in the 1950s, with a few very rare eight-panel strips, that still fit into the four-panel mold. In 1975, the panel format was shortened slightly horizontally, and shortly after the lettering became larger to accommodate the shrinking format. Beginning on Leap Day in 1988, Schulz abandoned the four-panel format in favor of three-panel dailies and occasionally used the entire length of the strip as one panel, partly for experimentation, but also to combat the dwindling size of the comics page.\\n\\nSchulz continued the strip until his retirement resulting from failing health; he died the day before the final Sunday strip was published.\\n\\nEnd of Peanuts\\n\\nThe final daily original Peanuts comic strip was published on Monday, January 3, 2000. The strip contained a note to the readers of the strip from Schulz and a drawing of Snoopy, with his trusty typewriter, sitting atop his doghouse deep in thought. Beginning the next day, a rerun package premiered in papers that had elected to pick it up (see below). Although Schulz did not draw any daily strips that were to run past January 3, he had drawn five extra Sunday strips and these had yet to run. The first of these strips appeared six days after the last daily on January 9.\\n\\nOn February 13, 2000, the day following Schulz\\'s death, the last-ever new Peanuts strip ran in papers. The strip, which was three panels in length, began with Charlie Brown answering the phone with someone on the end presumably asking for Snoopy. Charlie Brown responded with \"No, I think he\\'s writing.\" The panel next to it shows Snoopy sitting at his typewriter with the opening to a letter, addressed as \"Dear Friends\". The final panel features a large blue sky background over which several drawings from past strips are placed. Underneath those drawings is a colorized version of Schulz\\'s January 3 strip, with almost the same note he wrote to the fans which reads as follows:\\n\\n\\'\\n\\nMany other cartoonists paid tribute to Peanuts and Schulz by homages in their own strips, appearing on February 13, 2000 or in the week beforehand. The comic was reprinted the day after that, but only had the farewell letter. After Peanuts ended, United Feature Syndicate began offering the newspapers that ran it a package of reprinted strips under the title Classic Peanuts. The syndicate limited the choices to either strips from the 1960s or from the 1990s, although a newspaper was also given the option to carry both reprint packages if it desired. All Sunday strips in the package, however, come from the 1960s.\\n\\nDespite the end of the strip, Peanuts continues to be prevalent in multiple media, through widespread syndication, the publication of The Complete Peanuts, the release of several new television specials (all of which Schulz had worked on, but had not finished, before his death), and Peanuts Motion Comics. Additionally, BOOM! Studios has published a series of comic books, which feature new material by new writers and artists, although some of the new material is based on classic Schulz stories from decades past, as well as including some classic strips by Schulz, mostly Sunday color strips.\\n\\nUniversal Uclick\\'s website, GoComics.com, announced on January 5, 2015, that they would be launching what they called \"Peanuts Begins\", which is simply the entire history of the strip rerun from the beginning, in colorized form. They did this to honor the sixty-fifth anniversary of the debut of Peanuts. \\n\\nPeanuts Worldwide, LLC\\n\\nOn June 3, 2010, United Media sold all its Peanuts-related assets, including its strips and branding, to a new company, Peanuts Worldwide, LLC, a joint venture of the Iconix Brand Group (which owns 80 percent) and Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates (20 percent). In addition, United Media sold its United Media Licensing arm, which represents licensing for its other properties, to Peanuts Worldwide.   United Feature Syndicate continued to syndicate the strip, until February 27, 2011, when Universal Uclick took over syndication, ending United Media\\'s 60-plus-years stewardship of Peanuts.  (Universal Uclick would take over all of United Media\\'s syndicated offerings later that year.)\\n\\nCharacters\\n\\nThe initial cast of Peanuts was small, featuring only Charlie Brown, Shermy, Patty (not to be confused with Peppermint Patty) and (two days after the release of the first strip) a beagle, Snoopy. The first addition, Violet, was made on February 7, 1951. Other character introductions that soon followed were Schroeder, on May 30, 1951, as a baby; Lucy, on March 3, 1952; Lucy\\'s baby brother Linus, on September 19, 1952 (after his existence was first mentioned back on July 14); and Pig-Pen, on July 13, 1954.\\n\\nThough the strip did not have a lead character at the onset, it soon began to focus on Charlie Brown, a character developed from some of the painful experiences of Schulz\\' formative years. In early strips Charlie Brown was depicted as distinctly younger than his cohorts Patty and Shermy. Charlie Brown\\'s main characteristic is either self-defeating stubbornness or admirable determined persistence to try his best against all odds: he can never win a ballgame but continues playing baseball; he can never fly a kite successfully but continues trying to do so. Though his inferiority complex was evident from the start, in the earlier strips he also got in his own jabs when verbally sparring with Patty and Shermy. Some early strips also involved romantic attractions between Charlie Brown and Patty or Violet. On September 1, 1958 Charlie Brown\\'s father was formally revealed to be a barber (after earlier instances in the strip that linked Charlie Brown to barbers by implication). In 1960, the now popular line of Charlie Brown greeting cards was introduced by Hallmark Cards. Charlie Brown and Snoopy reached new heights on May 18, 1969 as they became the names of the command module and lunar module, respectively, for Apollo 10.\\n\\nAs the years went by, Shermy, Patty and Violet appeared less often and were demoted to supporting roles (eventually disappearing from the strip in 1969, 1976, and 1984 respectively, although Patty and Violet were still seen as late as November 27, 1997), while new major characters were introduced. Schroeder, Lucy van Pelt, and her brother Linus debuted as very young children—with Schroeder and Linus both in diapers and pre-verbal. Snoopy also started to verbalize his thoughts via thought bubbles.\\n\\nOne recurring theme in the strip is Charlie Brown\\'s neighborhood baseball team. Charlie Brown is the player-manager of the team and, usually, its pitcher, and Schroeder is the catcher. The other characters of the strip comprise the rest of the team, including Linus playing as second baseman and Lucy as right fielder. Charlie Brown is a terrible pitcher, often giving up tremendous hits which either knock him off the mound or leave him with only his shorts on. The team itself is also poor, with only Snoopy, at shortstop, being particularly competent. Because of this, the team consistently loses. However, while the team is often referred to as \"win-less,\" it does win at least ten games over the course of the strip\\'s run, most of these when Charlie Brown is not playing, a fact that Charlie Brown finds highly dispiriting. \\n\\nIn the  late 1950s, Snoopy, a character previously minor, began to have a gradual increase in appearance, and in the 1960s, he became a major character. The naming of the command module and lunar module for Apollo 10 – \"Charlie Brown\" and \"Snoopy\" respectively, as mentioned earlier in this text, is testament to the character\\'s standing at that time. Many of the strips from the 1960s onwards revolve around Snoopy\\'s active, Walter Mitty-like fantasy life, in which he would imagine himself in various roles, including a World War One Flying Ace, a World Famous author, and a college student named Joe Cool. Although the names give his imaginary roles self-praise, he fails in his fantasies.\\n\\nSchulz continued to introduce new characters into the strip, particularly including a tomboyish, freckle-faced, shorts-and-sandals-wearing girl named Patricia Reichardt, better known as Peppermint Patty. Peppermint Patty is an assertive, athletic but rather obtuse girl who shakes up Charlie Brown\\'s world by calling him \"Chuck\", flirting with him and giving him compliments he is not so sure he deserves. She also brings in a new group of friends (and heads a rival baseball team), including the strip\\'s first black character, Franklin; a Mexican-Swedish kid named José Peterson, and Peppermint Patty\\'s bookish sidekick Marcie, who calls Peppermint Patty \"Sir\" and Charlie Brown \"Charles\" and sometimes \"Chuck\" (most characters only referred to him as \"Charlie Brown\", though he was known as \"Charles\" to Eudora, \"big brother\" to his sister Sally Brown, \"that round-headed kid\" to Snoopy, and as \"Brownie Charles\" to Peggy Jean after misspeaking his name out of nervousness).\\n\\nSeveral additional family members of the characters were also introduced: Charlie Brown\\'s younger sister Sally, who became fixated on Linus; Linus and Lucy van Pelt\\'s younger brother Rerun, who almost always found himself on the back of his mother\\'s bike for a time; and Spike, Snoopy\\'s desert-dwelling brother from Needles, California, who was apparently named for Schulz\\' own childhood dog. Snoopy also had six other siblings, and a total of five of his siblings made some appearances in the strip (his brothers Andy, Olaf, and Marbles (in addition to Spike) and his sister Belle).\\n\\nOther notable characters include Snoopy\\'s friend Woodstock, a bird whose chirping is represented in print as hash marks but is nevertheless clearly understood by Snoopy; three of Woodstock\\'s buddies who usually appeared when on a scouting trip with Snoopy as their scout leader; Pig-Pen, the perpetually dirty boy who could raise a cloud of dust on a clean sidewalk, in a snowstorm, or inside a building; and Frieda, a girl proud of her \"naturally curly hair,\" and who owned a cat named Faron, much to Snoopy\\'s chagrin (the way Faron hung over Frieda\\'s arms prompted Snoopy to comment that they had \"finally developed a boneless cat\"). Frieda eventually disappeared from the strip.\\n\\nPeanuts had several recurring characters that were actually absent from view. Some, such as the Great Pumpkin or Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron), were merely figments of the cast\\'s imaginations. Others were not imaginary, such as the Little Red-Haired Girl (Charlie Brown\\'s perennial dream girl who finally appeared in 1998, but only in silhouette), Joe Shlabotnik (Charlie Brown\\'s baseball hero), World War II (the vicious cat who lives next door to Snoopy—not to be confused with Frieda\\'s cat, Faron), and Charlie Brown\\'s unnamed pen pal, referred to as his \"pencil-pal\" after Charlie Brown\\'s failed mastery of the fountain pen. Adult figures only appeared in the strip during a four-week Sunday-comic sequence in 1954 in which Lucy plays in an amateur golf tournament, with Charlie Brown \"coaching\" her. At no time, however, were any adult faces seen (it was also in this story that Lucy\\'s family name, \"van Pelt\", was first revealed.) There are adult voices in a few of the strips in its early years.\\n\\nSchulz also added some fantastical characters, sometimes imbuing inanimate objects with sparks of life. Charlie Brown\\'s nemesis, the Kite-Eating Tree, is one example. Sally Brown\\'s school building, that expressed thoughts and feelings about the students (and the general business of being a brick building), is another. Linus\\' famous \"security blanket\" also displayed occasional signs of anthropomorphism. Another example is Charlie Brown\\'s pitching mound, which at times would express thoughts and opinions (\"Why don\\'t you learn how to pitch, you stupid kid?\").\\n\\nCritical reception and legacy\\n\\nPeanuts is regarded as one of the most influential and well-written comic strips of all time. Schulz received the National Cartoonist Society Humor Comic Strip Award for Peanuts in 1962, the Reuben Award in 1955 and 1964 (the first cartoonist to receive the honor twice), the Elzie Segar Award in 1980, and the Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. A Charlie Brown Christmas won a Peabody Award and an Emmy; Peanuts cartoon specials have received a total of two Peabody Awards and four Emmys. For his work on the strip, Charles Schulz (along with Snoopy) are credited with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and a place in the William Randolph Hearst Cartoon Hall of Fame. Peanuts was featured on the cover of Time on April 9, 1965, with the accompanying article praising the strip as being \"the leader of a refreshing new breed that takes an unprecedented interest in the basics of life.\" \\n\\nConsidered among the greatest comic strips of all time, Peanuts was declared second in a list of the greatest comics of the 20th century commissioned by The Comics Journal in 1999.  Peanuts lost out to George Herriman\\'s Krazy Kat, a strip Schulz admired (and in fact was among his biggest inspirations), and he accepted the positioning in good grace, to the point of agreeing with the result.  In 2002 TV Guide declared Snoopy and Charlie Brown equal 8th  in their list of \"Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\",  published to commemorate their 50th anniversary.\\n\\nCartoon tributes have appeared in other comic strips since Schulz\\' death in 2000, and are now displayed at the Charles Schulz Museum.  In May 2000, many cartoonists included a reference to Peanuts in their own strips. Originally planned as a tribute to Schulz\\' retirement, after his death that February it became a tribute to his life and career. Similarly, on October 30, 2005, several comic strips again included references to Peanuts, and specifically the It\\'s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown television special.\\n\\nThe December 1997 issue of The Comics Journal featured an extensive collection of testimonials to Peanuts. Over forty cartoonists, from mainstream newspaper cartoonists to underground, independent comic artists, shared reflections on the power and influence of Schulz\\' art. Gilbert Hernandez wrote \"Peanuts was and still is for me a revelation. It\\'s mostly from Peanuts where I was inspired to create the village of Palomar in Love and Rockets. Schulz\\' characters, the humor, the insight... gush, gush, gush, bow, bow, bow, grovel, grovel, grovel...\" Tom Batiuk wrote \"The influence of Charles Schulz on the craft of cartooning is so pervasive it is almost taken for granted.\" Batiuk also described the depth of emotion in Peanuts: \"Just beneath the cheerful surface were vulnerabilities and anxieties that we all experienced, but were reluctant to acknowledge. By sharing those feelings with us, Schulz showed us a vital aspect of our common humanity, which is, it seems to me, the ultimate goal of great art.\" \\n\\nIn 2001, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors renamed the Sonoma County Airport, located a few miles northwest of Santa Rosa, California, the Charles M. Schulz Airport in his honor. The airport\\'s logo features Snoopy as the World War I Flying Ace (goggles/scarf), taking to the skies on top of his red doghouse (the Sopwith Camel). A bronze statue of Charlie Brown and Snoopy stands in Depot Park in downtown Santa Rosa. \\n\\nSchulz was included in the touring exhibition \"Masters of American Comics\" based on his achievements in the art form while producing the strip. His gag work is hailed as being \"psychologically complex,\" and his style on the strip is noted as being \"perfectly in keeping with the style of its times.\"\\n\\nDespite the widespread acclaim generated by Peanuts as a whole, some critics have alleged a decline in the strip\\'s quality in the later years of its run, as Schulz frequently digressed from the more cerebral socio-psychological themes that characterized his earlier work in favor of lighter, more whimsical fare. For example, in an essay published in the New York Press at the time of the final daily strip in January 2000, \"Against Snoopy,\" Christopher Caldwell argued that the character of Snoopy, and the strip\\'s increased focus on him in the 1970s, \"went from being the strip\\'s besetting artistic weakness to ruining it altogether\". \\n\\nTelevision and film productions\\n\\nVideo rights to all the films and TV specials were licensed by Media Home Entertainment and Kartes Video Communications in the 1980s. In the early 1990s, the rights were acquired by Paramount Pictures and the company released all of the TV specials under their Paramount Home Video label. The distribution rights to the TV specials are now with Warner Bros. Television and Warner Home Video, who purchased the rights from Paramount in 2007, and managed by its classic animation division. Paramount holds the home media rights to all four theatrical releases, having acquired the rights to A Boy Named Charlie Brown and Snoopy, Come Home following the merger of its parent Viacom with CBS; CBS\\' former subsidiary Cinema Center Films released the first two films in theaters and CBS/Fox Video released them on home video while Paramount handled production and home video distribution Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown and Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don\\'t Come Back!!). The two companies do not share distribution of the films on television; CBS Television Distribution handles the first two films while Trifecta Entertainment and Media handles the later two.\\n\\n1959–1965: Beginnings\\n\\nIn addition to the strip and numerous books, the Peanuts characters have appeared in animated form on television numerous times. This started when the Ford Motor Company licensed the characters in early 1959 for a series of color television commercials for its automobiles and intros for The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show which they sponsored. While the show ended in 1961, the deal lasted another three years. The ads were animated by Bill Meléndez for Playhouse Pictures, a cartoon studio that had Ford as a client. Schulz and Meléndez became friends, and when producer Lee Mendelson decided to make a two-minute animated sequence for a TV documentary called A Boy Named Charlie Brown in 1963, he brought on Meléndez for the project.\\n\\n1965–1971: Television specials and theatrical films\\n\\nBefore the documentary was completed, the three of them (with help from their sponsor, the Coca-Cola Company) produced their first half-hour animated special, the Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning A Charlie Brown Christmas, which was first aired on the CBS network on December 9, 1965. This episode is undoubtedly the most widely recognized of all Peanuts TV specials. This came after Coca-Cola asked Mendelson if he had a Christmas special. He said \"yes.\" The next day he called Schulz up and said they were making A Charlie Brown Christmas.\\n\\nThe animated version of Peanuts differs in some aspects from the strip. In the strip, adult voices are heard, though conversations are usually only depicted from the children\\'s end. To translate this aspect to the animated medium, the sound of a trombone with a solotone mute (created by Vince Guaraldi  played by Dean Hubbard    ) was used to simulate adult \"voices.\" A more significant deviation from the strip was the treatment of Snoopy. In the strip, the dog\\'s thoughts are verbalized in thought balloons; in animation, he is typically mute, his thoughts communicated through growls or laughs (voiced by Bill Meléndez), and pantomime, or by having human characters verbalizing his thoughts for him. These treatments have both been abandoned temporarily in the past. For example, they experimented with teacher dialogue in She\\'s a Good Skate, Charlie Brown. The elimination of Snoopy\\'s \"voice\" is probably the most controversial aspect of the adaptations, but Schulz apparently approved of the treatment.\\n\\nThe success of A Charlie Brown Christmas was the impetus for CBS to air many more prime-time Peanuts specials over the years, beginning with Charlie Brown\\'s All-Stars and It\\'s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown in 1966. In total, more than thirty animated specials were produced. Until his death in 1976, jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi composed musical scores for the specials; in particular, the piece \"Linus and Lucy\" which has become popularly known as the signature theme song of the Peanuts franchise.\\nSchulz, Mendelson and Meléndez also collaborated on four theatrical feature films starring the characters, the first of which was A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969). Most of these made use of material from Schulz\\' strips, which were then adapted, although in other cases plots were developed around areas where there were minimal strips to reference.\\n\\n1971–1976: Final golden years\\n\\nThe 1971 TV special Play It Again, Charlie Brown was the first time that someone other than Peter Robbins voiced Charlie Brown which in this case was Chris Inglis. The characters voices were slightly deeper than usual. It would be like that for the rest of the TV specials.\\nIn 1972, the second feature film Snoopy Come Home was released. This was the first time that Snoopy\\'s thoughts were communicated to the audiences. The film\\'s theme of loss made it have as much sadness as any animation centering on Charlie Brown. Snoopy and Charlie Brown\\'s parting, Charlie Brown\\'s inability to cope without his friend, and Snoopy\\'s farewell to his former owner Lila are often pointed out as poignant moments in the history of Peanuts.\\nStarting with A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, Phil Roman would direct the specials.\\nIt\\'s Arbor Day, Charlie Brown was the last special produced during Vince Guaraldi\\'s lifetime as he died two months before this special aired. It was dedicated to him.\\n\\n1977–1981: Post-Guaraldi era\\n\\nEd Bogas composed the musical scores of Peanuts movies television specials 1977 until 1989. Judy Munsen composed the musical scores alongside Ed Bogas from 1977 until 1992. Desirée Goyette briefly composed the musical scores on and off during the 1980s. \\nRace for Your Life, Charlie Brown was the first project done after Guaraldi\\'s death. It used the same voice cast as You\\'re a Good Sport, Charlie Brown.\\nIt\\'s Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown and What a Nightmare, Charlie Brown! featured Linus & Lucy arrangement\\'s Ed Bogas and Judy Munsen.\\n\\n1982–1990: Vignettes and musicals\\n\\nStarting with A Charlie Brown Celebration Bill Melendez would direct the specials again.\\nA Charlie Brown Celebration, It\\'s an Adventure, Charlie Brown, and The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show all had vignettes while It\\'s Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown, You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown, and Snoopy!!! The Musical were musicals though there were two songs in Happy New Year, Charlie Brown!. It\\'s the Girl in the Red Truck, Charlie Brown was the only special during this period in which Ed Bogas, Judy Munsen, or Desiree Goyette weren\\'t involved in music production with Paul Rodriquez as the composer. The former and latter would stop scoring the specials in 1990.\\n\\n1990–2000: Charles M. Schulz\\' final years\\n\\nDavid Benoit redid Vince Guaraldi\\'s musical scores 1992 until 2006. Since then various compers have composed the musical scores in more recent productions.\\nBy the mid-1990s, the specials\\' popularity had begun to wane, and CBS showed disinterest in new specials, even rejecting It\\'s Spring Training, Charlie Brown completely. An eight-episode TV miniseries called This is America, Charlie Brown, for instance, was released during a writer\\'s strike. Also, NBC aired You\\'re in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown in 1994 (the first special not to air on CBS) ten days before Super Bowl XXVIII. Eventually, the last Peanuts specials made during Schulz\\' lifetime were released direct-to-video, and no new ones were created until after the year 2000 when ABC obtained the rights to the three fall holiday specials. The Nickelodeon cable network re-aired a package of most of the specials produced before 1992, as well as The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show and This Is America, Charlie Brown, under the umbrella title You\\'re on Nickelodeon, Charlie Brown between 1997 and 2001.\\n\\n2000–present: new specials\\n\\nEight Peanuts-based specials have been made posthumously. Of these, three are tributes to Peanuts or other Peanuts specials, and five are completely new specials based on dialogue from the strips and ideas given to ABC by Schulz before his death. He\\'s a Bully, Charlie Brown, was telecast on ABC on November 20, 2006, following a repeat broadcast of A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. Airing 43 years after the first special, the premiere of He\\'s a Bully, Charlie Brown was watched by nearly 10 million viewers, winning its time slot and beating a Madonna concert special.  In the 2010 Macy\\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade, it was announced that a new Peanuts animated special, Happiness Is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown, would debut in 2011. The special was released on DVD first, on March 29, 2011, and later premiered on Fox, on November 24, 2011.\\n\\nMany of the specials and feature films have also been released on various home video formats over the years. To date, 20 of the specials, the two films A Boy Named Charlie Brown and Snoopy, Come Home, and the miniseries This Is America, Charlie Brown have all been released to DVD.\\n\\nIn October 2007, Warner Bros. acquired the Peanuts catalog from Paramount for an undisclosed amount of money. As aforementioned, they now hold the worldwide distribution rights for all Peanuts properties including over 50 television specials—these are originally managed by Warner Bros. Television and Warner Bros. Television Animation. Warner has made plans to develop new specials for television as well as the direct to video market, as well as short subjects for digital distribution, and some of these have in fact already been released via Warner Premiere. Paramount retains the rights to the theatrical releases, as the first two movies (A Boy Named Charlie Brown and Snoopy, Come Home) are owned by CBS and distributed for home video through Paramount while CTD distributes for television, and the other two (Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown and Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don\\'t Come Back!!)) were handled in-house by Paramount, with Trifecta holding TV distribution rights.\\n\\nPeanuts Worldwide has partnered with Normaal Animation and France Télévisions to produce 500 90-second animated short films, adapted from the strip Peanuts, which aired in fall 2014, including on French television station France 3. \\n\\nThe Peanuts Movie (2015)\\n\\nIn October 2012, it was announced that a 3D computer-animated  feature film titled The Peanuts Movie was released on November 6, 2015, coinciding with the 65th anniversary of the debut of the comic strip and the 50th anniversary of the television special, A Charlie Brown Christmas. Written by Charles Schulz\\'s son, Craig, his grandson, Bryan, and Cornelius Uliano—who are also producing the film alongside Paul Feig —it was animated by 20th Century Fox\\'s Blue Sky Studios, and directed by Steve Martino, the director of Horton Hears a Who! and Ice Age: Continental Drift.   A trailer for the film was released on March 18, 2014. The same day, it was also announced that archive recordings of Bill Melendez would be used to make up Snoopy and Woodstock\\'s dialogue.\\n\\nBooks\\n\\nThe Peanuts characters have been featured in many books over the years.  Some represented chronological reprints of the newspaper strip, while others were thematic collections such as Snoopy\\'s Tennis Book, or collections of inspirational adages such as Happiness Is a Warm Puppy. Some single-story books were produced, such as Snoopy and the Red Baron. In addition, many of the animated television specials and feature films were adapted into book form.\\n\\nThe first primary series of reprints was published by Rinehart & Company (later Holt, Rinehart and Winston) beginning in 1952, with the release of a collection simply titled Peanuts. This series, which presented the strips in rough chronological order (albeit with many strips omitted from each year) continued through the 1980s, after which reprint rights were handed off to various other publishers. Ballantine Books published the last original series of Peanuts reprints, including Peanuts 2000, which collected the final year of the strip\\'s run.\\n\\nCoinciding with these reprints were smaller paperback collections published by Fawcett Publications. Drawing material from the main reprints, this paperback series began with The Wonderful World of Peanuts in 1962 and continued through Lead On, Snoopy in 1992.\\n\\nCharles Schulz had always resisted republication of the earliest Peanuts strips, as they did not reflect the characters as he eventually developed them. However, in 1997 he began talks with Fantagraphics Books to have the entire run of the strip, which would end up with 17,897 strips total, published chronologically in book form.  In addition to the post-millennium Peanuts publications are BOOM! Studios restyling of the comics and activity books, and \"First Appearances\" series. Of which its content produced by Peanuts Studio, subsequently an arm of Peanuts Worldwide LLC.\\n\\n* Chip Kidd, ed. (2001) Peanuts: The Art of Charles M. Schulz. New York: Pantheon Books.

A companion series, titled Peanuts Every Sunday and presenting the complete Sunday strips in color (as the main Complete Peanuts books reproduce them in black and white only), was launched in December 2013; this series will run ten volumes, with the last expected to be published in 2022.\\n\\nIn addition, almost all Peanuts strips are now also legally available online at GoComics.com (there are some strips missing from the digital archive). Peanuts strips were previously featured on Comics.com.\\n\\nAnniversary books\\n\\nSeveral books have been released to commemorate key anniversaries of Peanuts:\\n* 20th (1970)\\xa0– Charlie Brown & Charlie Schulz\\xa0— a tie-in with the TV documentary Charlie Brown and Charles Schulz that had aired May 22, 1969\\n* 25th (1975)\\xa0– Peanuts Jubilee\\n* 30th (1980)\\xa0– Happy Birthday, Charlie Brown\\n* 35th (1985)\\xa0– You Don\\'t Look 35, Charlie Brown\\n* 40th (1990)\\xa0– Charles Schulz: 40 Years of Life & Art\\n* 45th (1995)\\xa0– Around the World in 45 Years\\n* 50th (2000)\\xa0– Peanuts: A Golden Celebration\\n* 50th (2000)\\xa0– 50 Years of Happiness: A Tribute to Charles Schulz\\n* 60th (2009)\\xa0– Celebrating Peanuts \\n\\nTheatrical productions\\n\\nPeanuts characters even found their way to the live stage, appearing in the musicals You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown and Snoopy!!!\\xa0— The Musical, and in \"Snoopy on Ice\", a live Ice Capades-style show aimed primarily at young children, all of which have had several touring productions over the years.  You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown was originally a successful Off-Broadway musical that ran for four years (1967–1971) in New York City and on tour, with Gary Burghoff as the original Charlie Brown. An updated revival opened on Broadway in 1999, and by 2002 it had become the most frequently produced musical in American theatre history. It was also adapted for television twice, as a live-action NBC special and an animated CBS special. Snoopy!!! The Musical was a musical comedy based on the Peanuts comic strip, originally performed at Lamb\\'s Theatre Off-Broadway in 1982. In its 1983 run in London\\'s West End, it won an Olivier Award. In 1988, it was adapted into an animated TV special. The New Players Theatre in London staged a revival in 2004 to honor its 21st anniversary, but some reviewers noted that its \"feel good\" sentiments had not aged well. The Off-Broadway drama Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead centers on the Peanuts characters becoming teenagers, though it is an unauthorized parody. \\n\\nSound recordings\\n\\nIn 1962 Columbia Records issued an album titled Peanuts, with Kaye Ballard and Arthur Siegel performing (as Lucy and Charlie Brown, respectively) to music composed by Fred Karlin.\\n\\nFantasy Records issued several albums featuring Vince Guaraldi\\'s jazz scores from the animated specials, including Jazz Impressions of a Boy Named Charlie Brown (1964), A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965), Oh, Good Grief! (1968), Charlie Brown\\'s Holiday Hits (1998), and Peanuts Portraits (2010). All were later reissued on CD.\\n\\nColumbia Records released soundtrack albums for the films A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969) and Snoopy, Come Home (1972), although neither has been reissued on CD.\\n\\nOther jazz artists have recorded Peanuts-themed albums, often featuring cover versions of Guaraldi\\'s compositions. These include Ellis Marsalis, Jr. and Wynton Marsalis (Joe Cool\\'s Blues, 1995); George Winston (Linus & Lucy, 1996); David Benoit (Here\\'s to You, Charlie Brown!, 2000, and Jazz for Peanuts, 2008); and Cyrus Chestnut (A Charlie Brown Christmas, 2000). The 1989 GRP Records release Happy Anniversary, Charlie Brown! and the 2005 Peak Records release 40 Years: A Charlie Brown Christmas also include interpretations of Guaraldi\\'s themes by various smooth jazz and blues artists.\\n\\nThe 1960s American rock band The Royal Guardsmen recorded several songs about Snoopy\\'s fantasies of flying against the Red Baron in World War I, including the hit singles \"Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron\" and \"Snoopy\\'s Christmas.\" The first song was released without Schulz\\'s consent, and he and UFS sued successfully for royalties, but allowed the group to make future songs and even contributed album artwork for such releases as Snoopy and His Friends.\\n\\nCast recordings (in both original and revival productions) of the stage musicals You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown and Snoopy!!! The Musical have been released over the years.\\n\\nNumerous animated Peanuts specials were adapted into book-and-record sets, issued on the \"Charlie Brown Records\" imprint by Disney Read-Along in the 1970s and \\'80s. Also issued on Charlie Brown Records, via Disneyland Records, was the soundtrack to Flashbeagle in 1984, which featured Desiree Goyette and Joey Scarbury (of \"Theme from the Greatest American Hero\" fame) on the title track and other songs written by Ed Bogas and Goyette.\\n\\nIn 1992 RCA Victor released an album of classical piano music ostensibly performed by Schroeder himself. Titled Schroeder\\'s Greatest Hits, the album contains solo piano works by Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, and others, performed by John Miller, Ronnie Zito, Ken Bichel, and Nelly Kokinos.\\n\\nAmusement parks\\n\\nIn 1983, Knott\\'s Berry Farm, in Southern California, was the first theme park to license the Peanuts characters, creating the first Camp Snoopy area and making Snoopy the park\\'s mascot. Knott\\'s expanded its operation in 1992 by building an indoor amusement park in the Mall of America, called Knott\\'s Camp Snoopy. The Knott\\'s theme parks were acquired by the national amusement park chain Cedar Fair Entertainment Company in 1997, which continued to operate Knott\\'s Camp Snoopy park until the mall took over its operation in March 2005.  Cedar Fair had already licensed the Peanuts characters for use in 1992 as atmosphere,  so its acquisition of Knott\\'s Berry Farm did not alter the use of those characters.\\n\\nSnoopy is currently the official mascot of all the Cedar Fair parks. It was previously used in all of the park logos but it has since been removed. Cedar Fair also operated a Camp Snoopy area at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, Worlds of Fun, and Valleyfair featuring various Peanuts-themed attractions until 2011. There is still a Camp Snoopy area at Cedar Point and Knott\\'s Berry Farm.\\n\\nIn 2008, Cedar Point introduced Planet Snoopy, a children\\'s area where Peanuts Playground used to be. This area consists of family and children rides that were relocated from Cedar Point\\'s sister park Geauga Lake after its closing. The rides are themed around the Peanuts characters. The area also consists of a \"Kids Only\" restaurant called Joe Cool Cafe (there is a small menu for adults). In 2010, the Nickelodeon Central and Nickelodeon Universe areas in the former Paramount Parks (California\\'s Great America, Canada\\'s Wonderland, Carowinds, Kings Dominion, and Kings Island) were replaced by Planet Snoopy . In 2011, Cedar Fair announced it would also add Planet Snoopy to Valleyfair, Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Worlds of Fun, replacing the Camp Snoopy areas. Planet Snoopy is now at every Cedar Fair park besides Knott\\'s Berry Farm and Michigan\\'s Adventure.\\n\\nAlso the Peanuts characters can be found at Universal Studios Japan in the Universal Wonderland section along with the characters from Sesame Street and Hello Kitty. \\n\\nOther licensed appearances and merchandise\\n\\nOver the years, the Peanuts characters have appeared in ads for Dolly Madison snack cakes, Chex Mix, Bounty, Cheerios, A&W Root Beer, Kraft Foods, and Ford automobiles.    Pig-Pen appeared in a memorable spot for Regina vacuum cleaners. \\n\\nThey are currently spokespeople in print and television advertisements for the MetLife insurance company.  MetLife usually uses Snoopy in its advertisements as opposed to other characters: for instance, the MetLife blimps are named \"Snoopy One\" and \"Snoopy Two\" and feature him in his World War I flying ace persona.  Starting in 2011, the annual New York Giants and New York Jets preseason football game is called the MetLife Bowl. The winning team receives a trophy which depicts Snoopy carrying a football, wearing an old-style football helmet and holding his arm up as if to ward off a tackler. \\n\\nThe characters have been featured on Hallmark Cards since 1960,  and can be found adorning clothing, figurines, plush dolls, flags, balloons, posters, Christmas ornaments, and countless other bits of licensed merchandise.     \\n\\nThe Apollo 10 lunar module was nicknamed \"Snoopy\" and the command module \"Charlie Brown\".  While not included in the official mission logo, Charlie Brown and Snoopy became semi-official mascots for the mission.   Charles Schulz drew an original picture of Charlie Brown in a spacesuit that was hidden aboard the craft to be found by the astronauts once they were in orbit. This drawing is now on display at the Kennedy Space Center. Snoopy is the personal safety mascot for NASA astronauts,  and NASA issues a Silver Snoopy award to employees that promote flight safety. The black \"caps\" that the Apollo astronauts wore on their heads were referred to as \"Snoopy hats.\"\\n\\nIn East Asia, RM Licensing has licensed the Peanuts characters for fashion stores, children\\'s apparel, and restaurants  including Charlie Brown Cafe, a Hong Kong-based fast causal restaurant chain.  There is also a Charlie Brown Cafe, themed with Peanuts characters, in Hongdae, Mapo-gu, Seoul, South Korea. \\n\\nThe 1960s pop band The Royal Guardsmen drew inspiration from Peanuts, and their single \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\" reached number two on the charts. \\n\\nIn the 1960s, Robert L. Short interpreted certain themes and conversations in Peanuts as being consistent with parts of Christian theology, and used them as illustrations during his lectures about the gospel, and as source material for several books, as he explained in his bestselling paperback book, The Gospel According to Peanuts.\\n\\nIn 1980, Charles Schulz was introduced to artist Tom Everhart during a collaborative art project.  Everhart became fascinated with Schulz\\'s art style and worked Peanuts themed art into his own work. Schulz encouraged Everhart to continue with his work. Everhart continues to be the only artist authorized to paint Peanuts characters. \\n\\nGiant helium balloons of Charlie Brown and Snoopy have long been a feature in the annual Macy\\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City. This was referenced in a Super Bowl XLII commercial for Coca-Cola, in which the Charlie Brown balloon snags a Coca-Cola bottle from two battling balloons (Underdog and Stewie Griffin).\\n\\nPeanuts on Parade is St. Paul, Minnesota\\'s tribute to Peanuts.  It began in 2000, with the placing of 101 5 ft statues of Snoopy throughout the city of Saint Paul. The statues were later auctioned at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. In 2001, there was \"Charlie Brown Around Town\", 2002 brought \"Looking for Lucy\", and in 2003, \"Linus Blankets Saint Paul\".  Permanent bronze statues of the Peanuts characters are found in Landmark Plaza in downtown Saint Paul. \\n\\nThe Peanuts characters have been licensed to Universal Studios Japan (while Peanuts merchandise in Japan has been licensed by Sanrio, best known for Hello Kitty). \\n\\nThe Peanuts characters have appeared in various video games, such as Snoopy in a 1984 by Radarsoft, Snoopy and the Red Baron for the Atari 2600, Snoopy\\'s Silly Sports Spectacular (1989, Nintendo Entertainment System), Snoopy\\'s Magic Show (1990, Game Boy), Snoopy Tennis (2001, Game Boy Color), Snoopy Concert which was released in 1995 and sold to the Japanese market for the Super NES, and in October 2006, a second game titled Snoopy vs. The Red Baron by Namco Bandai for the PlayStation 2. In July 2007, the Peanuts characters appeared in the Snoopy the Flying Ace mobile-phone game by Namco Networks.\\n\\nIn 1980 (with a new edition published in 1990), the Funk & Wagnalls publishing house also produced a children\\'s encyclopedia called the Charlie Brown\\'s \\'Cyclopedia. The 15-volume set features many of the Peanuts characters.\\n\\nA Peanuts WWI Flying Ace U.S. commemorative postage stamp was released on 17 May 2001. The value was 34 cents, First Class. \\n\\nIn April 2002, The Peanuts Collectors Edition Monopoly board game was released by USAopoly. The game was created by Justin Gage, a prolific collector and friend of Charles and Jeannie Schulz. The game was dedicated to Schulz in memory of his passing.']}, 'search_results': {'description': ['Peanuts 1950s. The first Peanuts comic strip from ...

Schulz drawing Snoopy .\\nPeanuts is a syndicated daily and Sunday comic strip written and illustrated by Charles M. Schulz , which ran from October 2, 1950, to February 13, 2000 (the day after Schulz\\'s death). In total 17,897 different Peanuts strips were published. The strip was one of the most popular and influential in the history of the medium, and considered the most beloved comic strips of all time. It was \"arguably the longest story ever told by one human being,\\'\"\\' according to Professor Robert Thompson of Syracuse University. At its peak, Peanuts ran in over 2,600 newspapers, with a readership of 355 million in 75 countries, and was translated into 21 languages. It helped to cement the four-panel gag strip as the standard in the United States. Reprints of the strip are still syndicated and run in many newspapers.\\nIn addition, Peanuts achieved considerable success for its television specials, several of which, including A Charlie Brown Christmas and It\\'s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown won or were nominated for Emmys. The holiday specials remain quite popular to this day, and are currently broadcast on ABC in the United States during the appropriate season.\\nContents\\nPeanuts 1940s\\nFront cover of a collection of Li\\'l Folks comic strips.\\nPeanuts had its origin in Li\\'l Folks , a weekly panel comic that appeared in Schulz\\'s hometown paper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, from 1947 to 1950. He first used the name Charlie Brown for a character there, although he used the name on four different occasions in Li\\'l Folks for different boys. The series also featured a dog that looked a lot like Snoopy . In 1948, Schulz sold a cartoon to the Saturday Evening Post; seventeen single-panel cartoons by Schulz would be published there.\\nIn 1948, Schulz tried to have Li\\'l Folks syndicated through the Newspaper Enterprise Association. Schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but the deal fell through. Li\\'l Folks was dropped in 1949. The next year, Schulz approached the United Features Syndicate with his best work from Li\\'l Folks.\\nWhen his work was picked up by United Features Syndicate, they decided to run the new comic strip he had been working on. This strip was similar in spirit to the panel comic, but it had a set cast of characters, rather than different nameless little folk for each page. Unfortunately, the name Li\\'l Folks was too similar to the names of two other comics of the time: Al Capp\\'s Li\\'l Abner and a now-forgotten strip titled Little Folks. To avoid confusion, the syndicate settled on the name Peanuts, a title Schulz always disliked. In a 1987 interview, Schulz said of the title Peanuts: \"It\\'s totally ridiculous, has no meaning, is simply confusing, and has no dignity — and I think my humor has dignity\". The periodic collections of the strips in paperback book form typically had either \"Charlie Brown\" or \"Snoopy\" in the title, not \"Peanuts\", due to Schulz\\'s distaste for his strip\\'s title. The Sunday panels eventually typically read, Peanuts, featuring Good Ol\\' Charlie Brown .\\nPeanuts 1950s\\nThe first Peanuts comic strip from October 2, 1950.\\nPeanuts premiered on October 2, 1950 in seven newspapers nationwide: The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, The Minneapolis Tribune, The Allentown Call-Chronicle, The Bethlehem Globe-Times, The Denver Post and The Seattle Times. It began as a daily strip; its first Sunday strip appeared January 6, 1952, in the half page format, which was the only complete format for the entire life of the Sunday strip.\\nBy the end of the 1950s only eleven characters had beeen introduced, namely Charlie Brown , Shermy , Patty , Snoopy , Violet , Schroeder , Lucy , Linus , Pig-Pen , Charlotte Braun and Sally . There were no minor characters, except for Charlotte Braun, although she was not originally supposed to be one.\\nCharlotte Braun made a very limited number of appearances in the Peanuts strip.\\nBy the time the first Peanuts Sunday strip appeared, the dailies had been reduced from full page strips to a mere four panels. While this reduced the capacity for artistic expression, the shortage of space allowed Schulz to create a new style for the medium. Schulz made the decision to produce all aspects of the strip, from the script to the finished art and lettering, himself. Thus the strip was able to be presented with a unified tone, and Schulz was able to employ a minimalistic style. Backgrounds were generally eschewed, and when utilised Schulz\\'s frazzled lines imbued them with a fraught, psychological appearance. This style has been described by art critic John Carlin as forcing \"its readers to focus on subtle nuances rather than broad actions or sharp transitions.\"\\nWhile the strip in its early years resembles its later form, there are significant differences. The art was cleaner and sleeker, though simpler, with thicker lines and short, squat characters. For example, in these early strips, Charlie Brown\\'s famous round head is closer to the shape of a football. In fact, most of the kids were initially fairly round-headed.\\nPeanuts 1960s-1990s\\n\"5\", a Peanuts character introduced in 1963.\\nFranklin.\\nPeppermint Patty.\\nPeanuts is remarkable for its deft social commentary, especially compared with other strips appearing in the 1950s and early 1960s. Schulz did not explicitly address racial and gender equality issues so much as he assumed them to be self-evident in the first place. Peppermint Patty \\'s athletic skill and self-confidence is simply taken for granted, for example, as is Franklin \\'s presence in a racially-integrated school and neighborhood.\\nSchulz could throw barbs at any number of topics when he chose, though. Over the years he tackled everything from the Vietnam War to school dress codes to the \"new math\". One of his most prescient sequences came in 1963 when he added a little boy named \" 5 \" to the cast, whose sisters were named \"3\" and \"4\" , and whose father had changed the family surname to their ZIP Code to protest the way numbers were taking over people\\'s identities. In 1957, a strip in which Snoopy tossed Linus into the air, and boasted that he was the first dog ever to launch a human, parodied the hype associated with Sputnik 2\\'s launch of \"Laika\" the dog into space earlier that year. Another sequence lampooned Little Leagues and \"organized\" play, when all the neighborhood kids join snowman-building leagues and criticize Charlie Brown when he insists on building his own snowmen without leagues or coaches..\\nPeanuts touched on religious themes on many occasions, most notably in the classic television special A Charlie Brown Christmas in 1965, which features the character Linus van Pelt quoting the King James Version of the Bible (Luke 2:8-14) to explain to Charlie Brown \"what Christmas is all about.\" (In personal interviews, Schulz mentioned that Linus represented his spiritual side.)\\nPeanuts probably reached its peak in American pop-culture awareness between 1965 and 1980; this period was the heyday of the daily strip, and there were numerous animated specials and book collections. During the 1980s other strips rivaled Peanuts in popularity, most notably Doonesbury, Garfield, The Far Side, Bloom County, and Calvin and Hobbes. However, Schulz still had one of the highest circulations in daily newspapers.\\nThe daily Peanuts strips were formatted in a four-panel \"space saving\" format beginning in the 1950s, with a few very rare eight panel strips, that still fit into the four-panel mold. On June 16, 1975 ,\\xa0the panel format was shortened slightly horizontally, and\\xa0shortly after the lettering became larger to accommodate the shrinking format. In 1988, Schulz abandoned this strict format and started using the entire length of the strip, in part to combat the dwindling size of the comics page, and also to experiment. Most daily Peanuts strips in the 1990s were three-panel strips.\\nPeanuts 2000s\\nThe final original daily Peanuts comic strip was published on January 3, 2000. The strip consisted simply of Snoopy sitting at his typewriter in thought with a note from Schulz that read as follows:\\n“\\nDear Friends,\\nI have been fortunate to draw Charlie Brown and his friends for almost fifty years. It has been the fulfillment of my childhood ambition. Unfortunately, I am no longer able to maintain the schedule demanded by a daily comic strip, My family does not wish Peanuts to be continued by anyone else, therefore I am announcing my retirement. I have been grateful over the years for the loyalty of our editors and the wonderful support and love expressed to me by fans of the comic strip. Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy...how can I ever forget them...\\n”\\nAlthough the daily strips came to an end, six more original Sunday Peanuts strips had yet to be published. The final original Sunday strip was published in newspapers a day after Schulz\\'s death on February 12. The final Sunday strip included all of the text from the final daily strip, and the only drawing: that of Snoopy typing in the lower right corner. It also added several classic scenes of the Peanuts characters surrounding the text. Following its finish, many newspapers began reprinting older strips under the title Classic Peanuts. Though it no longer maintains the \"first billing\" in as many newspapers as it enjoyed for much of its original run, Peanuts remains one of the most popular and widely syndicated strips today.\\nCast of characters\\nSome well known Peanuts characters. From the left, Franklin , Woodstock , Lucy van Pelt , Snoopy , Linus van Pelt , Charlie Brown , Peppermint Patty and Sally Brown .\\nThe initial cast of Peanuts was small, featuring only Charlie Brown , Shermy , Patty (not to be confused with Peppermint Patty ), and a beagle, Snoopy .\\nThough the strip did not have a lead character at the onset, it soon began to focus on Charlie Brown , a character developed from some of the painful experiences of Schulz\\'s formative years. Charlie Brown\\'s main characteristic is either self-defeating stubbornness or admirable determined persistence to try his best against all odds: he can never win a ballgame, but continues playing baseball ; he can never fly a kite successfully, but continues trying to fly his kite. Though his inferiority complex was evident from the start, in the earliest strips he also got in his own jabs when verbally sparring with Patty and Shermy. Some early strips also involved romantic attractions between Charlie Brown and Patty or Violet (the next major character added to the strip).\\nAs the years went by, Shermy and Patty appeared less often and were demoted to supporting roles, while new major characters were introduced. Schroeder , Lucy , and her brother Linus debuted as very young children — Schroeder and Linus both in diapers and pre-verbal. Snoopy, who began as a more-or-less typical puppy, soon started to verbalize his thoughts via thought bubbles. Eventually he adopted other human characteristics, such as walking on his hind legs, reading books, using a typewriter, and participating in sports. He also grew from being a cute little puppy to a full-grown dog.\\nIn the 1960s, the strip began to focus more on Snoopy. Many of the strips from this point revolve around Snoopy\\'s active, Walter Mitty-like fantasy life, in which he imagined himself to be a World War I Flying Ace or a bestselling suspense novelist , to the bemusement and consternation of the other characters who sometimes wonder what he is doing but also at times participate. Snoopy eventually took on many more distinct personas over the course of the strip, notably college student \" Joe Cool \".\\nMarcie was introduced to Peanuts in 1971.\\nSchulz continued to introduce new characters into the strip, including a tomboyish, freckle-faced, shorts-and-sandals-wearing girl named Patricia Reichardt, better known as \" Peppermint Patty .\" \"Peppermint\" Patty is an assertive, athletic, but rather obtuse girl who shakes up Charlie Brown\\'s world by calling him \"Chuck,\" flirting with him, and giving him compliments he is not sure he deserves. She also brings in a new group of friends, including the strip\\'s first black character, Franklin , and Peppermint Patty\\'s bookish sidekick Marcie , who calls Peppermint Patty \"Sir\" and Charlie Brown \"Charles.\"\\nSeveral additional family members of the characters were also introduced: Charlie Brown\\'s younger sister Sally , who is fixated on Linus; Linus and Lucy\\'s younger brother Rerun ; and Spike , Snoopy\\'s desert-dwelling brother from Needles, California, who was apparently named for Schulz\\'s own childhood dog.\\xa0More of\\xa0 Snoopy\\'s siblings \\xa0were later introduced into the strip. \\xa0\\nFrieda , introduced to Peanuts in 1963.\\nOther notable characters include: Snoopy\\'s friend Woodstock , a bird whose chirping is represented in print as little black lines but is nevertheless clearly understood by Snoopy; Pig-Pen , the perpetually dirty boy who could raise a cloud of dust on a clean sidewalk or in a snowstorm; and Frieda , a girl proud of her \"naturally curly hair\", and who owned a cat named Faron , much to Snoopy\\'s chagrin.\\nPeanuts had several recurring characters who were actually absent from view. Some, such as the\\xa0 Great Pumpkin or the Red Baron , may or may not have been figments of the cast\\'s imaginations. Others were not imaginary, such as the Little Red-Haired Girl (Charlie Brown\\'s perennial dream girl), Joe Shlabotnik (Charlie Brown\\'s baseball hero),\\xa0 World War II a vicious cat who\\xa0terrifies his neighbor,\\xa0Snoopy, and Charlie Brown\\'s unnamed pencil pal . After some early anomalies, adult figures never appeared in the strip.\\nSchulz also added some fantastic elements, sometimes imbuing inanimate objects with sparks of life. Charlie Brown\\'s nemesis, the Kite-Eating Tree , is one example. Sally Brown\\'s school building , that expressed thoughts and feelings about the students (and the general business of being a brick building), is another. Linus\\' famous \" security blanket \" also displayed occasional signs of anthropomorphism.\\nAges of the Peanuts characters\\nCharlie Brown says that he is four years old in the strip from November 3, 1950 .\\nOver the course of their nearly fifty-year run, most of the characters did not age more than two years. An exception are the characters who were introduced as infants, caught up with the rest of the cast, then stopped. Rerun is unique in that he stopped aging in kindergarten. Linus was first mentioned in the strip as Lucy\\'s baby brother, on September 19, 1952 . He aged to around Charlie Brown\\'s age over the course of the first ten years, during which we see him learn to walk and talk with the help of Lucy and Charlie Brown . When Linus stops aging he is about a year or so younger than Charlie Brown. Charlie himself was four when the strip began, and aged over the next two decades until he settled in as an eight-year-old (after which he is consistently referred to as eight when any age is given). Sally remains two years younger than her older brother Charlie Brown, although Charlie Brown was already of school age in the strips when she was born and seen as a baby.\\nIn one strip, when Lucy declares that by the time a child is five years old, his personality is already pretty well established, Charlie Brown protests, \"But I\\'m already five! I\\'m more than five!\"\\nCharlie Brown says that he is six years old in the strip from November 17, 1957 .\\nThe characters, however, were not strictly defined by their literal ages. \"Were they children or adults? Or some kind of hybrid?\" wrote David Michaelis of Time magazine. Schulz distinguished his creations by \"fusing adult ideas with a world of small children.\" Michaelis continues:\\n“ Through his characters, \"[Schulz] brought... humor to taboo themes such as faith, intolerance, depression, loneliness, cruelty and despair. His characters were contemplative. They spoke with simplicity and force. They made smart observations about literature, art, classical music, theology, medicine, psychiatry, sports and the law.\" ”\\nIn other words, the cast of Peanuts transcended age, and are more broadly human.\\nCurrent events were sometimes a subject of the strip over the years. In a 1995 series, Sally mentions the Classic Comic Strip Characters series of stamps, which were released four years earlier, and a story about the Vietnam War ran for ten days in the 1960s. The passage of time, however, is negligible and incidental in Peanuts.\\nCritical acclaim\\nCharles M. Schulz receives his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at Knott\\'s Berry Farm , Buena Park, California in June 1996.\\nPeanuts is often regarded as one of the most influential and well-written comic strips of all time. Schulz received the National Cartoonist Society Humor Comic Strip Award for Peanuts in 1962, the Elzie Segar Award in 1980, the Reuben Award in 1955 and 1964, and the Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. A Charlie Brown Christmas won a Peabody Award and an Emmy; Peanuts cartoon specials have received a total of two Peabody Awards and four Emmys. For his work on the strip, Charles Schulz is credited with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and a place in the William Randolph Hearst Cartoon Hall of Fame. Peanuts was featured on the cover of Time magazine on April 9, 1965, with the accompanying article praising the strip as being \"the leader of a refreshing new breed that takes an unprecedented interest in the basics of life.\"\\nConsidered amongst the greatest comic strips of all time, Peanuts was declared second in a list of the greatest comics of the 20th century commissioned by The Comics Journal in 1999. Peanuts lost out to George Herriman\\'s Krazy Kat, a strip Schulz himself admired and accepted the positioning in good grace, to the point of agreeing with the result. In 2002 TV Guide declared Snoopy and Charlie Brown equal eighth in their list of \"Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\", published to commemorate their 50th anniversary.\\nCartoon tributes have appeared in other comic strips since Schulz\\'s death in 2000. In May of that year, many cartoonists included a reference to Peanuts in their own strips. Originally planned as a tribute to Schulz\\'s retirement, after his death that February it became a tribute to his life and career. Similarly, on 30 October 2005, several comic strips again included references to Peanuts, and specifically the It\\'s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown television special.\\nA series of statues were erected in St. Paul, Minnesota, Schulz\\'s hometown, which represented a different character each year. The \"Peanuts on Parade\" tribute began in 2001 with Snoopy statues, followed by Charlie Brown in 2002, Lucy in 2003, Linus in 2004, and Snoopy and Woodstock lying on top of Snoopy\\'s doghouse in 2005.\\nIn 2001, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors renamed the Sonoma County Airport, located a few miles northwest of Santa Rosa, California, the Charles M. Schulz Airport in his honor. The airport\\'s amusing logo features Snoopy in goggles and scarf, taking to the skies on top of his red doghouse. A bronze statue of Charlie Brown and Snoopy stands in Depot Park in downtown Santa Rosa.\\nSchulz himself was included in the touring exhibition \"Masters of American Comics\" based on his achievements in the artform whilst producing the strip. His gag work is hailed as being \"psychologically complex\", and his style on the strip is noted as being \"perfectly in keeping with the style of its times.\"\\nTelevision and film productions\\nShermy in the first Peanuts animated television special, A Charlie Brown Christmas .\\nIn addition to the strip and numerous books, the Peanuts characters have appeared in animated form on television numerous times. This started when the Ford Motor Company licensed the characters in 1961 for a series of black and white television commercials for the Ford Falcon. The ads were animated by Bill Melendez for Playhouse Pictures, a cartoon studio that had Ford as a client. Schulz and Melendez became friends, and when producer Lee Mendelson decided to make a two-minute animated sequence for a TV documentary called A Boy Named Charlie Brown in 1963, he brought on Melendez for the project. Before the documentary was completed, the three of them (with help from their sponsor, the Coca-Cola Company ) produced their first half-hour animated special, the Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning A Charlie Brown Christmas , which was first aired on the CBS network on 9 December 1965.\\nThe animated version of Peanuts differs in some aspects from the strip. In the strip, adult voices are heard by the characters but conversations are usually only depicted from the children\\'s end. To translate this aspect to the animated medium, Melendez famously used the sound of a trombone with a plunger mute opening and closing on the bell to simulate adult \"voices\". A more significant deviation from the strip was the treatment of Snoopy . In the strip, the dog\\'s thoughts are verbalized in thought balloons; in animation, he is typically mute, his thoughts communicated through growls, laughs or an un-canine like chirping sound (voiced by Bill Melendez), and pantomime, or by having human characters verbalizing his thoughts for him. These treatments have both been abandoned temporarily in the past. For example, they experimented with teacher dialogue in She\\'s a Good Skate, Charlie Brown . The elimination of Snoopy\\'s \"voice\" is probably the most controversial aspect of the adaptations, but Schulz apparently approved of the treatment. (Snoopy\\'s thoughts were conveyed in voiceover for the first time in animation in the animated version of the Broadway musical You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown , and later on occasion in the animated series The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show .)\\nMelendez had some initial concerns about animating the Peanuts character the way Schulz designed them. They are limited in terms of mobility, for example, arms could only be raised so far. Melendez did not want to compromise the integrity of Schulz\\'s work, and found creative ways of resolving problems presented by their design.\\nTitle card for It\\'s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.\\nThe success of A Charlie Brown Christmas was the impetus for CBS to air many more prime-time Peanuts. specials over the years, beginning with Charlie Brown\\'s All-Stars and It\\'s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown in 1966. In total, more than thirty animated specials were produced. Until his death in 1976, jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi composed highly acclaimed musical scores for the specials; in particular, the piece \" Linus and Lucy \" which has become popularly known as the signature theme song of the Peanuts franchise.\\nIn addition to Coca-Cola, other companies that sponsored Peanuts specials over the years included Dolly Madison cakes , Kellogg\\'s, McDonald\\'s , Peter Paul-Cadbury candy bars, General Mills, and Nabisco.\\nSchulz, Mendelson, and Melendez also collaborated on four theatrical feature films starring the characters, the first of which was A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969). Most of these made use of material from Schulz\\'s strips, which were then adapted, although in other cases plots were developed around areas where there were minimal strips to reference. Such was also the case with The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show , a Saturday-morning TV series which debuted on CBS in 1983 and lasted for three seasons.\\nHappy New Year, Charlie Brown! is an animated TV special based on Peanuts that first aired in 1986.\\nBy the late-1980s, the specials\\' popularity had begun to wane, and CBS sometimes rejected a few specials. An eight-episode TV miniseries called This is America, Charlie Brown , for instance, was released during a writer\\'s strike. Eventually, the last Peanuts specials were released direct-to-video, and no new ones were created until after the year 2000 when ABC obtained the rights to the three fall holiday specials. The Nickelodeon cable network re-aired the bulk of the specials, as well as The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show, for a time in the late 1990s under the umbrella title You\\'re On Nickelodeon, Charlie Brown. Many of the specials and feature films have also been released on various home video formats over the years.\\nEight Peanuts-based specials have been made after Shulz\\'s death. Of these, three are tributes to Peanuts or previous Peanuts animated specials, and five are completely new specials based on dialogue from the strips, and ideas given to ABC by Schulz before his death. He\\'s a Bully, Charlie Brown , was telecast on ABC on November 20, 2006, following a repeat broadcast of A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving . Airing forty-one years after the first special, the premiere of He\\'s a Bully, Charlie Brown was watched by nearly ten million viewers, winning its time slot and beating a Madonna concert special.\\nTheatrical productions\\nPoster for the 1971 Broadway production of You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown.\\nThe Peanuts characters even found their way to the live stage, appearing in the musicals You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown and Snoopy!!! The Musical , and in Snoopy on Ice, a live Ice Capades-style show aimed primarily at young children, all of which have had several touring productions over the years.\\nYou\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown was originally an extremely successful off-Broadway musical that ran for four years (1967-1971) in New York City and on tour, with Gary Burghoff as the original Charlie Brown. An updated revival opened on Broadway in 1999, and by 2002 it had become the most frequently produced musical in American theater history. It was also adapted for television twice, as a live-action NBC special and an animated CBS special .\\nSnoopy!!! The Musical was a musical comedy based on the Peanuts comic strip, originally performed at Lamb\\'s Theatre off-Broadway in 1982. In its 1983 run in London\\'s West End, it won an Olivier Award. In 1988, it was adapted into an animated TV special . The New Players Theatre in London staged a revival in 2004 to honor its 21st anniversary, but some reviewers noted that its \"feel good\" sentiments had not aged well.\\nRecord albums\\nVince Guaraldi.\\nIn 1962, Columbia Records issued an album titled Peanuts, with Kaye Ballard and Arthur Siegel performing (as Lucy and Charlie Brown , respectively) to music composed by Fred Karlin.\\nFantasy Records issued several albums featuring Vince Guaraldi \\'s jazz scores from the animated specials, including Jazz Impressions of a Boy Named Charlie Brown (1964), A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965), Oh, Good Grief! (1968), and Charlie Brown\\'s Holiday Hits (1998). All were later reissued on CD.\\nOther jazz artists have recorded Peanuts-themed albums, often featuring cover versions of Guaraldi\\'s compositions. These include Ellis Marsalis, Jr. and Wynton Marsalis (Joe Cool\\'s Blues, 1995); George Winston (Linus & Lucy, 1996); David Benoit (Here\\'s to You, Charlie Brown!, 2000); and Cyrus Chestnut (A Charlie Brown Christmas, 2000).\\nCast recordings (in both original and revival productions) of the stage musicals You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown and Snoopy!!! The Musical have been released over the years.\\nNumerous animated Peanuts specials were adapted into book-and-record sets, issued on the \"Charlie Brown Records\" label by Disney Read-Along in the 1970s and \\'80s.\\nOther licensed appearances and merchandise\\nSnoopy the World War I Flying Ace on the MetLife blimp.\\nOver the years, the Peanuts characters have appeared in advertisements for Dolly Madison snack cakes, Friendly\\'s restaurants, A&W Root Beer, Cheerios breakfast cereal, and Ford automobiles. \"Pig-Pen\" appeared in a memorable spot for Regina vacuum cleaners.\\nThey are currently spokespeople in print and television advertisements for the MetLife insurance company. MetLife usually uses Snoopy in its advertisements as opposed to other characters: for instance, the MetLife blimps are named \"Snoopy One\" and \"Snoopy Two\" and feature him in his World War I Flying Ace persona.\\nThe characters have been featured on Hallmark Cards since 1960, and can be found adorning clothing, figurines, plush dolls, flags, balloons, posters, Christmas ornaments, and countless other bits of licensed merchandise.\\nThe Apollo 10 lunar module was nicknamed \"Snoopy\" and the command module \"Charlie Brown\". While not included in the official mission logo, Charlie Brown and Snoopy became semi-official mascots for the mission. Schulz also drew some special mission-related artwork for NASA , and at least one regular strip related to the mission, where Charlie Brown consoles Snoopy about how the spacecraft named after him was left in lunar orbit.\\nThe 1960s pop band, The Royal Guardsmen , released several Snoopy-themed albums and singles, including their debut album in 1966 featuring the song \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron \", which made it to number two on request charts. The band followed with several other Snoopy-themed songs, but they did not do as well: \"The Return of the Red Baron\", \"Snoopy and His Friends\",\" Snoopy\\'s Christmas\" and \"Snoopy for President\". Many of these featured cover art by Charles Schulz.\\nIn the 1960s, Robert L. Short interpreted certain themes and conversations in Peanuts as being consistent with parts of Christian theology, and used them as illustrations during his lectures about the gospel, and as source material for several books, as he explained in his bestselling paperback book, The Gospel According to Peanuts.\\nIn 1980, Charles Schulz was introduced to artist Tom Everhart during a collaborative art project. Everhart became fascinated with Schulz\\'s art style and worked Peanuts themed art into his own work. Schulz encouraged Everhart to continue with his work. Everhart continues to be the only artist authorized to paint Peanuts characters.\\nGiant helium balloons of Charlie Brown and Snoopy have long been a feature in the annual Macy\\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.\\nThe characters were licensed for use in 1992 as atmosphere for the national amusement park chain Cedar Fair.The images of the Peanuts characters are used frequently, most visibly in several versions of the logo for flagship park, Cedar Point. Knott\\'s Berry Farm, which was later acquired by Cedar Fair, was the first theme park to make Snoopy its mascot. Cedar Fair also operated Camp Snoopy , an indoor amusement park in the Mall of America until the mall took over its operation as of March 2005, renaming it The Park at MOA, and no longer using the Peanuts characters as its theme.\\nThe Peanuts characters have been licenced to Universal Studios Japan. Peanuts merchandise in Japan has been licensed by Sanrio, best known for Hello Kitty.\\nPeanuts characters at the Snoopy\\'s World theme park in New Town Plaza, Sha Tin, Hong Kong.\\nIn New Town Plaza, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, there is a mini theme park dedicated to Snoopy.\\nThe Peanuts gang have also appeared in video games, such as Snoopy in a 1984 by Radarsoft, Snoopy Tennis (Game Boy Color), and in October 2006, Snoopy vs. the Red Baron by Namco Bandai. Many Peanuts characters have cameos in the latter game, including Woodstock , Charlie Brown , Linus , Lucy , Marcie and Sally .\\nPeanuts has also been involved with NASCAR. In 2000, Jeff Gordon drove his #24 Chevrolet with a Snoopy -themed motif at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Two years later, Tony Stewart drove a #20 Great Pumpkin motif scheme for two races. The first, at Bristol Motor Speedway, featured a black car with Linus sitting in a pumpkin field. Later, at Atlanta Motor Speedway, Tony drove an orange car featuring the Peanuts characters trick-or-treating. Most recently, Bill Elliott drove a #6 Dodge with an A Charlie Brown Christmas scheme. That car ran at the 2005 NASCAR BUSCH Series race at Memphis Motorsports Park..\\nIn April of 2002 The Peanuts Collectors Edition Monopoly board was released by USAopoly. The game was created by Justin Gage, a prolific collector and friend of Charles and Jeannie Schulz. The game was dedicated to Schulz in memory of his passing.\\nWhen asked whether he felt that licensing threatened to \"commercialize\" the strip, Schulz said that would be impossible, because comic strips were already a commercial product, designed to sell newspapers. \"How can a commercial product be accused of turning commercial?\" He also did not feel licensing cheapened the artistic integrity of Peanuts. Comic strips, he said, are not a \"pure art form, by any means.\"\\nBooks\\nCover of the 2001 book Peanuts: The Art of Charles Schulz\\nThe Peanuts characters have been featured in many books over the years. Some represented chronological reprints of the newspaper strip, while others were thematic collections, such as Snoopy\\'s Tennis Book. Some single-story books were produced, such as Snoopy and the Red Baron. In addition, most of the animated television specials and feature films were adapted into book form.\\nCharles Schulz always resisted publication of early Peanuts strips, as they did not reflect the characters as he eventually developed them. However, in 1997 he began talks with Fantagraphics Books to have the entire run of the strip, almost 18,000 cartoons, published chronologically in book form. The first volume in the collection, The Complete Peanuts \\': 1950 to 1952, was published in April 2004. Peanuts is in a unique situation compared to other comics in that archive quality masters of most strips are still owned by the syndicate. All strips, including Sundays, are in black and white.\\nThe books, like the strips themselves, continue to be issued on an ongoing basis, proof that Peanuts, even after more than sixty years, still continues to resonate with readers of all ages.', '20 Things You Didn\\'t Know About Charles Schulz | The Huffington Post\\n20 Things You Didn\\'t Know About Charles Schulz\\n11/26/2013 08:34 am ET | Updated Oct 19, 2016\\n2k\\nABC Photo Archives via Getty Images\\nToday is the birthday of American cartoonist Charles Monroe Schulz, that beloved \"Peanuts\" creator who would turn 91 years old if he were still alive today.\\nBorn in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Schulz is remembered most fondly for the wholesome characters he created throughout his 50-year-long illustration career. Among them are the eternally hesitant Charlie Brown and the mischievous Snoopy, two characters who came to represent the iconic four-panel gag strip known as \"Peanuts.\" Schulz devoted much of his life to the American comic standard, which ran up until the day after his death in 2000.\\nIn honor of the 91st anniversary of Schulz\\'s birth, we wanted to shine a spotlight on the man behind the cartoon, so we\\'ve put together 20 facts you might not have known about the great American artist. Behold, the quirks of a \"Peanuts\" legend:\\n1. The man, Charles Schulz, and the comic character, Charlie Brown, are pretty similar.\\nSchulz\\'s father was a barber and his mother a housewife, just like Charlie Brown\\'s parents. Plus, as the youngest in his class at Central High School in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Schulz was famously shy.\\n2. Schulz\\'s childhood nickname was based on a comic strip.\\nSchulz\\'s childhood nickname, Sparky, was given to him by his uncle and refers to the horse Spark Plug in Billy DeBeck\\'s comic strip, \"Barney Google .\"\\n3. Schulz had his own unusual dog named Spike.\\nWhen Schulz was a young boy, he submitted a picture of his dog, Spike, to Ripley\\'s Believe It or Not! His drawing appeared in Robert Ripley\\'s syndicated panel, describing Spike as an unusual dog who ate pins, tacks and razor blades.\\n4. Schulz served in WWII but never fired his weapon.\\nIn 1943, Schulz was drafted into the United States Army where he served as a staff sergeant with the 20th Armored Division in Europe. During his service as a squad leader on a .50 caliber machine gun team, his unit saw very little combat, and Schulz later explained that during the only opportunity to fire his machine gun he discovered that he had actually forgotten to load it.\\n5. Schulz debuted his two most famous characters in a comic strip known as \"Li\\'l Folks.\"\\nThe name of Schulz\\'s most famous character -- Charlie Brown -- first appeared in an earlier cartoon written by the Peanuts creator titled \"Li\\'l Folks\" , which was published from 1947 to 1950. That same series also featured a dog that resembled Snoopy.\\n6. Schulz didn\\'t actually name \"Peanuts.\"\\nIn 1950, Schulz approached the United Feature Syndicate with his comic strip Li\\'l Folks. The syndication company accepted Schulz work but decided that the name \"Li\\'l Folks\" was too close to the names of two other comics of the time: Al Capp\\'s \"Li\\'l Abner\" and a strip titled \"Little Folks.\" So, to avoid confusion, United Feature Syndicate settled on the name \"Peanuts\" after the peanut gallery featured in the \"Howdy Doody\" TV show. In the end, Schulz did not name his famous work.\\n7. And he hated the name.\\nSchulz always disliked the title of his famous comic strip, \"Peanuts\". In a 1987 interview , Schulz said of the name: \"It\\'s totally ridiculous, has no meaning, is simply confusing, and has no dignity -- and I think my humor has dignity.\"\\n8. Schulz wanted to call Snoopy \"Sniffy.\"\\nSchulz was originally going to call his star dog character \" Sniffy\" , that is until he discovered that name had already been used in a different comic strip. So the cartoonist changed it to \"Snoopy\" after remembering that his late mother Dena Schulz told the family that if they were ever to acquire a third dog, it should be called Snoopy, an affectionate term in Norwegian. (The word is \"Snuppa\".)\\n9. And Schulz wanted Snoopy to be entirely silent.\\nSchulz originally imagined Snoopy as a silent character. It was only after two years of the comic that Snoopy verbalized his thoughts to readers in a thought balloon in 1952.\\n10. Schulz named many of the other \"Peanuts\" characters after his friends.\\nLinus and Shermy , prominent characters in the Peanuts comic strip, were named for good friends of Schulz, Linus Maurer and Sherman Plepler.\\n11. Relatives served as inspiration too.\\nThe character of Peppermint Patty was inspired by Patricia Swanson, one of Schulz\\'s cousins on his mother\\'s side. Schulz came up with the full name when he saw peppermint candies in his house.\\n12. And ex-girlfriends.\\nThe character of the Little Red-Haired Girl (Charlie Brown\\'s love interest in \"Peanuts\") was based on a woman in Schulz\\'s life named Donna Mae Johnson. She was an Art Instruction Inc. accountant with whom the cartoonist had a relationship, but when he proposed to her, she turned him down.\\n13. Schulz was adamant about \"A Charlie Brown Christmas.\"\\nFor \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\", network executives were hesitant about a scene involving Linus reciting the story of Christ\\'s birth. But in a documentary about the making of the program , Charles Schulz asks, \"If we don\\'t do it, who will?\" And so the scene remained. Schulz also felt strongly about the absence of a laugh track in the televised cartoon, maintaining that the audience should be able to enjoy the show at their own pace, without being cued when to laugh. CBS created a version with a laugh track, but that version never aired.\\n15. Schulz was an avid hockey fan.\\nSchulz was an avid hockey fan. In 1998, he hosted the first Over 75 Hockey Tournament and in 2001, and in 2001, Ramsey County renamed the Highland Park Ice Arena in St. Paul, Minn., the Charles M. Schulz Highland Arena in his honor.\\n16. Schulz loved the Space Program.\\nSchulz was also a huge proponent of the space program, so much so that the 1969 Apollo 10 command module was named Charlie Brown and a lunar module was named Snoopy.\\n17. Schulz was pals with Reagan.\\nRonald Reagan once wrote a fan note to Schulz saying that the president identified with Charlie Brown.\\n18. Schulz really wanted Charlie Brown to kick the football.\\nWhen Schulz was asked if Charlie Brown would finally get to kick the football in the final \"Peanuts\" strip, his response was: \"Oh, no! Definitely not! I couldn\\'t have Charlie Brown kick that football; that would be a terrible disservice to him after nearly half a century.\" But in a December 1999 interview , Schulz recounted the moment when he signed the final comic panel, stating, “All of a sudden I thought, \\'You know, that poor, poor kid, he never even got to kick the football. What a dirty trick -- he never had a chance to kick the football!\\'”\\n18. Schulz was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame.', 'Frequently Asked Questions - Charles M. Schulz Museum\\nCharles M. Schulz Museum\\nThe Peanuts Comic Strip\\nWhy is the comic strip named Peanuts?\\nOriginally, Charles Schulz named his strip Li’l Folks, but when it became syndicated in 1950 by United Feature Syndicate, there was concern about possible copyright infringement with a cartoon called Little Folks by Tack Knight that had been published in the 1930s. Schulz suggested Charlie Brown or Good Ol’ Charlie Brown, but the syndicate decided upon Peanuts. The name Peanuts was likely chosen because it was a well-known term for children at the time, popularized by the television program The Howdy Doody Show, which debuted in 1947 and featured audience section for children called the “Peanut Gallery.”\\n“I don’t like the name of my strip at all. I wanted to call it Good Old Charlie Brown, but the person at the syndicate who selected Peanuts just picked it at random from a list of possible titles he jotted down. He hadn’t even looked at the strip when he named it. The syndicate compromised on Sunday, though. Once I rebelled and sent it in without any title. We finally agreed to put Peanuts at the top and include Charlie Brown and His Gang in the sub-title on Sunday.”\\n– Charles M. Schulz, 1969\\nHow many newspapers has Peanuts appeared in?\\nPeanuts debuted in seven newspapers on October 2, 1950: The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, The Minneapolis Star-Tribune, The Allentown Call-Chronicle, The Bethlehem Globe-Times, The Denver Post, and The Seattle Times. Shortly after Schulz’s passing in 2000, Peanuts was reported to be printed in 2,600 newspapers in 75 countries in 21 languages.\\nWhat art tools did Charles Schulz use to create his comic strip?\\nThe Peanuts strips were drawn on Strathmore 3-ply paper with India ink. For lettering, Schulz used a Speedball C-5 pen and for drawing the strip he used an Esterbrook 914 radio pen. When Schulz learned that the company that manufactured the nibs for this pen was going out of business, he purchased their entire inventory of nibs.\\n\\xa0\\nHow many Peanuts strips did Charles Schulz create each week?\\nSchulz kept fairly regular office hours, Monday-Friday, working from about 9am-4pm. On average, he drew about seven strips per week, generally keeping six to eight weeks ahead of the publication schedule. He worked out his ideas on lined paper with sketches and notes; when he was satisfied with the idea, he would create the finished strip. Schulz said he could draw a daily strip anywhere from ten minutes to an hour, but that the Sunday strips always took longer.\\nHow many Peanuts comic strips were created? How are the Sunday strips colored?\\nCharles M. Schulz created a total of 17,897 Peanuts strips of which there are 15,391 daily strips and 2,506 Sunday strips. All Peanuts strips were originally created with black ink on white paper, whether they were dailies or Sundays. To indicate his color choices on the Sunday strips, Schulz would have a copy of the strip produced at a local print shop, then, using a color chart, he would select colors for each portion and send the syndicate a colored version along with corresponding color number IDs.\\nWhere can Peanuts comic strips be viewed today?\\nIn addition to being printed in numerous newspapers as reprints today, most of the Peanuts strips can be viewed online at Go Comics . High-resolution reprints of Peanuts strips can be ordered through the gocomics.com web site.\\nStrip reprint books can be found at new and used bookstores or local libraries. Peanuts is currently being collected in its entirety and published as The Complete Peanuts by Fantagraphics Books. When complete, this set of 25 books will reproduce every strip in chronological order; each book contains two years of strips; two books will be released each year for 12 1/2 years (the first book was released in 2004).\\n\\xa0\\nPeanuts Animation and Musical Productions\\nWhen was the first Peanuts animation created?\\nPeanuts was first animated by Bill Melendez in 1959 for the Tennessee Ernie Ford Show sponsored by Ford Motors. Melendez eventually formed his own company, Bill Melendez Productions, animating and directing all of the Peanuts television specials and full-length movies until his death in 2008. Melendez also provided the “voice” of Snoopy and Woodstock in Peanuts animation.\\nThe next instance of Peanuts animation was created for a documentary produced in 1963 by Lee Mendelson. The documentary, called A Boy Named Charlie Brown, never aired on television but included some animation by Melendez interspersed throughout the show. This documentary is now available on DVD only in the Schulz Museum Store . Lee Mendelson Productions produced all of the Peanuts animated television specials and feature films beginning with A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) through He’s a Bully, Charlie Brown (2006). Mendelson has also written several books about the making of the early animated specials and has been featured in numerous documentary interviews speaking about the history of Peanuts animation.\\nHow many Peanuts TV specials and movies are there?\\nA total of 45 Peanuts animated television specials, a Saturday morning television show (1983-1985) and an eight-part television mini-series on American history (1988) have been produced over the past five decades. Four full-length Peanuts motion pictures have been released in theatres: A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969), Snoopy Come Home (1972), Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown (1977), and Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don’t Come Back!!) (1980).\\nI had to animate Sparky’s [Charles Schulz’s] characters in such a way that you wouldn’t see the turns. I found ways of animating this and hiding the fact that [the] scope of the movement was very limited. … Snoopy saved me because Snoopy is more like a real animated character. He can do anything—move and dance—and he’s very easy to animate, whereas the kids are nearly impossible! I’ve always had to think quickly and learn how to cope with the limitations of the design.\\n– Bill Melendez, 2005\\nThe last animated special, Happiness Is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown, was released to DVD on March 29, 2011, and its first airing on television was on November 24, 2011. This special was animated by Wild Brain Entertainment and was directed by Andy Beall and Frank Molieri.\\nWho composes the music for Peanuts TV specials and movies?\\nThe songs Linus and Lucy and Christmas Time is Here are probably the two most well-known songs composed for Peanuts specials. Jazz musician Vince Guaraldi composed Linus and Lucy for a documentary on Charles Schulz which never aired, called A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1963). Lee Mendelson, the producer of the 1963 documentary and most other Peanuts specials and films, wrote the lyrics to the song Christmas Time is Here, and Guaraldi composed the tune. Guaraldi went on to compose music for 15 Peanuts specials and films until his untimely death in 1976.\\nIn addition to Guaraldi’s many Peanuts compositions through 1976’s It’s Arbor Day, Charlie Brown, the renowned Sherman Brothers wrote the original music for the full-length feature film Snoopy, Come Home in 1972. Richard and Robert Sherman’s legacy includes composing much of the celebrated music from the Disney films of the 1960s and 1970s. Ed Bogas began composing music for Peanuts animation in 1978 with What a Nightmare, Charlie Brown and contributed to much of the original Peanuts music through the 1980s. Bogas partnered with either Judy Munsen or Desiree Goyette on many of the animated Peanuts television specials and films in the early 1980s, with Munsen receiving full credit for supplying music for several of the specials through 1992’s It’s Spring Training, Charlie Brown.\\nThe eight-part animated mini-series This is America, Charlie Brown (1988) included many well-known composers in the credits: Ed Bogas, George Winston, Wynton Marsalis, Dave Brubeck, The Winans, David Benoit, and Dave Grusin. With the release of It’s Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown in the fall of 1992, David Benoit was again enlisted, arranging and performing the music of Vince Guaraldi in several of the television specials produced in the 1990s.\\nThe music for Happiness Is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown (2011) was composed by Mark Mothersbaugh, co-founder of the band Devo. Mothersbaugh has a long history of scoring television and film productions including many of the films of noted director Wes Anderson, who cites Peanuts animator and director Bill Melendez as an influence on his films—bringing the legacy of original Peanuts compositions full circle!\\nA summary of Peanuts music would not be complete without mentioning that Ludwig van Beethoven’s compositions can be heard in many of the Peanuts specials, due to Schroeder’s passion for this brilliant composer and pianist. One of the most memorable instances in A Charlie Brown Christmas is when Schroeder soulfully plays Bagatelle No. 25 in A minor for solo piano—commonly known as “Für Elise.”\\nSheet music for many of the compositions heard in Peanuts specials and films can be purchased at music stores, bookstores, and online retailers.\\nWhat are the names of the officially licensed Peanuts musicals?\\nThere are only two official Peanuts musicals: You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown and Snoopy!!! The Musical. You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown is the most well-known and considered to be one of the most performed musicals in the United States since its debut in 1967.\\nPeanuts Worldwide, LLC, which owns and manages the rights to Peanuts, does not at this time license the rights to A Charlie Brown Christmas for live performances due to various legal restrictions.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat are some of the significant Peanuts licensing milestones?\\nThe first licensed Peanuts products were paperback books published by Rinehart & Co. in 1952.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThe first Peanuts toys were manufactured by the Hungerford Doll Corporation in 1958 and included Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy, and Schroeder with his piano.\\nHallmark first began producing Peanuts greeting cards and booklets in 1960 and has continued to create Peanuts-themed cards and other items for over 50 years.\\nHappiness is a Warm Puppy was published in 1962 by Determined Productions, Inc., landing on the New York Times best-seller list for 45 weeks.\\nMacy’s has included a Peanuts character balloon in all Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parades since the debut of a Snoopy balloon in 1968.\\nCharles Schulz used MetLife as his personal insurer from at least 1967, but Peanuts wasn’t associated with the company until Snoopy became the MetLife Spokes-Beagle in 1985 with the launch of the “Get Met. It Pays.” advertising campaign. The MetLife Blimp Program debuted in 1987 and currently has three ships named after Snoopy: Snoopy One, Snoopy Two and Snoopy J.\\nSee more about the history of the partnership between Peanuts and MetLife.\\nCamp Snoopy opened at Knott’s Berry Farm in Buena Park, California in 1983, launching the first of many Camp Snoopy theme parks across the country. In 1992, the Mall of America opened its own Camp Snoopy, making it the largest indoor theme park in the nation (the Mall of America theme park is no longer associated with Camp Snoopy).\\n\\xa0\\nPeanuts Characters\\n“I think anybody who is writing finds he puts a little bit of himself in all of the characters, at least in this kind of a strip. It’s the only way that you can survive when you have to do something every day. You have to put yourself, all of your thoughts, all of your observations and everything you know into the strip.”\\n– Charles M. Schulz, 1984\\nDid Charlie Brown always wear his iconic zigzag shirt?\\nCharlie Brown appeared in the first Peanuts comic strip on October 2, 1950, but his first appearance in the famous zigzag shirt didn’t occur until the strip published on December 21, 1950.\\nHow many siblings does Snoopy have?\\nIn the Peanuts comic strip, Snoopy has five named siblings: Spike, Belle, Marbles, “Ugly” Olaf, and Andy. However, in the June 18, 1989 strip, Snoopy states that “there were eight of us in the litter.” In the animated special, Snoopy’s Reunion (1991), Snoopy’s other two siblings are mentioned by name; they are Molly and Rover.\\nWhat’s inside Snoopy’s doghouse?\\nAlthough Snoopy’s possessions are periodically described in Peanuts (including records, books, a Van Gogh painting, and a pool table), the interior of Snoopy’s doghouse is never actually shown in the comic strip. The only time the viewer sees inside Snoopy’s doghouse is in the 1981 animated special, It’s Magic, Charlie Brown.\\nDid Charles Schulz have a dog or dogs in his life that influenced his creation of Snoopy?\\n“Snoopy’s appearance and personality have changed probably more than those of any of the other characters. As my drawing style loosened, Snoopy was able to do more things, and when I finally developed the formula of using his imagination to dream of being many heroic figures, the strip took on a completely new dimension.”\\n– Charles M. Schulz, 1975\\nCharles Schulz had many dogs in his life, from his childhood dogs Snooky and Spike to the dogs his family had after he was married with children. Spike was cited as the biggest influence on the creation of Snoopy. Other dogs in the Schulz family included Major, Lucy, Carmel, Dropshot, and Andy. Schulz said that his favorite dog was Andy, a mixed-breed dog that was rescued by Jean Schulz from a fox terrier rescue group in 1988.\\nWhy are adults never shown in the Peanuts comics strip?\\n“I usually say that they [adults] do not appear because the daily strip is only an inch and a half high, and they wouldn’t have room to stand up. Actually, they have been left out because they would intrude in a world where they could only be uncomfortable. Adults are not needed in the Peanuts strip. In earlier days I experimented with off-stage voices, but soon abandoned this as it was not only impractical but actually clumsy. Instead, I have developed a cast of off-stage adults who are talked about but never seen or heard.”\\n– Charles M. Schulz, 1975\\nThis Peanuts strip was originally published on May 30, 1954.\\nWhile cloud gazing, which character in Peanuts responds to what he sees in the sky by stating - Well, I was going to say I saw a ducky and a horsie but I changed my mind?\\nThis Peanuts strip was originally published on August 14, 1960\\nAlthough Linus has much deeper philosophical visions in mind while cloud gazing, it is Charlie Brown who responds with his everyman response of seeing a “ducky and a horsie” in the Peanuts strip originally published on August, 14, 1960.\\nWho is the little girl playing tennis with Snoopy in the Peanuts strip from March 10, 1997?\\nPeanuts strip originally published on March 10, 1997\\nThat character is named “Crybaby” Boobie. She was introduced into the Peanuts strip in 1978 and is usually shown throwing her head back, crying about some injustice she has observed on the tennis court. Although she is most often shown wearing a polka dot dress and without the viewer seeing her face, the strips in the days leading up to this one indicate it is indeed “Crybaby” Boobie who Snoopy may have kicked at the end of another contentious tennis game.', 'Peanuts by Charles Schulz  | Read Comic Strips at GoComics.com\\nShare Link\\nExplore Peanuts', 'A Brief History of Charles Schulz\\'s \\'Peanuts\\' Comic Strip - TIME\\nFollow @TIME\\nWhen Alex Davis was 2 years old, he pointed to a drawing his father had done and exclaimed, \"Snoopy!\" The problem: his father was Jim Davis, the creator of Garfield, and the picture was of the cat he made famous. Charles Schulz\\'s black-and-white dog is so beloved, though, that a lasagna-loving cat can\\'t even compete. Saturday, Oct. 2, marks 60 years since Schulz\\'s first Peanuts strip hit newspapers. Since then, Snoopy, Charlie Brown and the gang have become the most recognizable cartoon characters in America \\x97 and have left an indelible mark on American culture.\\nYet leave it to the man behind Charlie Brown to experience disappointment before success. In 1947 Schulz started a cartoon feature called L\\'il Folks for the St. Paul Pioneer Press. It was a flop, never achieving a permanent spot in the paper. In 1950 he compiled his strips and sold the series to the United Features Syndicate, which changed its name to Peanuts. Schulz originally resisted the name change. \"I wanted to keep Li\\'I Folks,\" he told TIME in 1965. \"I wanted a strip with dignity and significance. Peanuts made it sound too insignificant.\"\\n(See the top 10 children\\'s books of 2009.)\\nThe first strip was printed on Oct. 2, 1950, and appeared in seven newspapers. In the strip, Charlie Brown walks by two friends, one of whom remarks, \"Well! Here comes \\'ol Charlie Brown! Good \\'ol Charlie Brown ... yes, sir! Good \\'ol Charlie Brown ... how I hate him!\" By the end of the decade, Peanuts had been picked up by hundreds of newspapers and had won Schulz a Reuben award, the highest honor given by the National Cartoonists Society.\\nSchulz\\'s Peanuts exploded during the 1960s, leaving its fingerprints on everything it touched. Charlie Brown and the gang even graced the cover of TIME in 1965. The influence didn\\'t go just one way, though \\x97 Peanuts evolved with the turbulent decade. After Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, fans pressed Schulz to include a black character; Franklin first appeared on July 31 of that year. Peppermint Patty, a multidimensional, sports-loving girl living in a single-parent household, made her debut in 1966. And Woodstock, Snoopy\\'s yellow, feathered companion, finally got his name in 1970. When asked why he named the bird after the music festival, Schulz simply replied, \"Why not?\"\\n(See the 100 best TV shows of all time.)\\nPeanuts triumphed off the printed page as well. In 1965 A Charlie Brown Christmas first aired, beginning a string of televised specials. Two later specials, You\\'re a Good Sport, Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, both took home Emmy awards. In 1967 Snoopy and friends hit the stage in an off-Broadway production, You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown, which ran for four years. It remains one of the most performed American musicals in history. Charlie Brown and Snoopy even went to the moon in 1969, after the Apollo X crew named their command and lunar modules after them. In later decades, Schulz\\'s work graced the Louvre and Carnegie Hall.\\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, Schulz had acquired a massive personal fortune. As he gave millions away to charity, he was frequently listed by Forbes magazine as one of the highest-paid entertainers in America, alongside Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson. He became the highest-paid and most widely read cartoonist of all time. By 1984, Peanuts had made the Guinness World Records after being syndicated to its 2,000th newspaper. Peanuts, which was read by 355 million people, raked in cash through newspaper licensing, book compilations, merchandising and endorsements.\\nSchulz\\'s health began to deteriorate in the 1990s. His hands developed a tremor, leaving his classic lines wobblier than usual. He suffered a stroke in November 1999 that impaired his vision, memory and motivation to draw. On Dec. 14, 1999, he announced his retirement. On Jan. 3, 2000, the last Peanuts daily strip was published. Schulz died of complications from colon cancer on Feb. 12, one day before his final Sunday strip hit the presses. He was 78. Schulz was posthumously given the Congressional Gold Medal, the body\\'s highest honor given to a civilian. To this day, kids around the world know and love Snoopy.', \"Charles M. Schulz, 'Peanuts' Creator, Dies at 77\\nCharles M. Schulz, 'Peanuts' Creator, Dies at 77\\nBy SARAH BOXER\\nCharles M. Schulz, the creator of ''Peanuts,'' the tender and sage comic strip starring Charlie Brown and Snoopy that is read by 355 million people around the world, died in his sleep on Saturday night at his home in Santa Rosa, Calif., just hours before his last cartoon ran in the Sunday newspapers. He was 77.\\nThe cause of death was colon cancer, said Paige Braddock, creative director for Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates.\\nMr. Schulz drew ''Peanuts'' for nearly half a century. He swore that no one else would ever draw the comic strip and he kept his word. For years he drew ''Peanuts'' with a hand tremor. He finally put down his pen when he received a diagnosis of colon cancer after abdominal surgery in November.\\nHis last daily strip ran on Jan. 3. His last Sunday page, which ran yesterday, carried a signed farewell in which he said, ''Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy . . . how can I ever forget them. . . .'' His wife, Jeannie, said, ''He had done everything he wanted.''\\nLynn Johnston, a friend of Mr. Schulz and the creator of ''For Better or for Worse,'' told The Associated Press, ''It's amazing that he dies just before his last strip is published.'' Such an ending, she said, was ''as if he had written it that way.''\\nShe recalled something Mr. Schulz told her as she sat in the hospital with him last year: ''You control all these characters and the lives they live. You decide when they get up in the morning, when they're going to fight with their friends, when they're going to lose the game. Isn't it amazing how you have no control over your real life?'' But, Ms. Johnston said, ''I think, in a way, he did.''\\nThe life of ''Peanuts'' and Charles Schulz were completely intertwined. ''The strip and he were one,'' said Patrick McDonnell, who draws the cartoon ''Mutts.'' ''He put his heart and soul into that strip.'' ''Peanuts,'' which reached readers in 75 countries, 2,600 papers and 21 languages every day, made Mr. Schulz very rich. The ''Peanuts'' strips, merchandise and product endorsements brought in $1.1 billion a year. And Mr. Schulz was said to have earned about $30 million to $40 million annually.\\nHis saga of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy and Linus ''is arguably the longest story ever told by one human being,'' Robert Thompson, a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University, observed on the PBS ''NewsHour'' with Jim Lehrer, longer than any epic poem, any Tolstoy novel, any Wagner opera. In all Mr. Schulz drew more than 18,250 strips in nearly 50 years.\\nJules Feiffer, the cartoonist and playwright, said that the ''Peanuts'' characters endure because they were the first real children in the comics pages, ones with doubts and anxieties. And there were a lot of them. ''Linus, Lucy, Charlie Brown -- these interesting little people formed a repertory company,'' he said.\\nA Long-Running Ensemble Act\\nThe cast of ''Peanuts'' changed remarkably little. It included Charlie Brown, a wishy-washy boy with a tree-loving kite and a losing baseball team; Snoopy, an unflappable beagle with a fancy inner life; Lucy, a fussbudget with a football and a curbside psychiatric clinic; Linus, a philosophical blanket-carrier; Sally, Charlie Brown's romantic little sister; Schroeder, a virtuoso on the toy piano and a Beethoven devotee; Peppermint Patty, a narcoleptic D-minus student; and, in later years, Woodstock, a small, expressive but speechless bird.\\nMr. Schulz remembered waking up in the night many years ago and thinking, ''Good grief, who are all these little people? Must I live with them for the rest of my life?'' The answer was yes.\\nCharles Monroe Schulz, the son of Carl Schulz, a barber, like Charlie Brown's father, and the former Dena Halverson, was born in Minneapolis on Nov. 26, 1922. Young Charles was nicknamed Sparky after the horse Spark Plug in the comic strip ''Barney Google.'' He had a black-and-white dog named Spike (memorialized in the character of Snoopy's skinny Western brother).\\nHe wanted to be a cartoonist as a child and practiced by drawing Popeye. ''Someday, Charles, you're going to be an artist,'' a kindergarten teacher told him after looking at his drawing of a man shoveling snow. His ambition was to do a comic strip as good as George Herriman's ''Krazy Kat,'' but Mr. Schulz also admired Picasso, Andrew Wyeth and Edward Hopper. Snoopy kept a van Gogh and a Wyeth in his doghouse.\\nThe hurts of Mr. Schulz's early years provided a lifetime of material. At Central High School in St. Paul, he flunked Latin, English, algebra and physics. ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' accepted one of his drawings when he was 15 -- a picture of Spike illustrating ''a hunting dog that eats pins, tacks and razor blades'' -- but the cartoons he drew for his high school yearbook were rejected. Mr. Schulz remembered his failures more vividly than his successes.\\nAfter his high school graduation he took a correspondence course from Art Instruction Inc., but before he could start a career he was drafted into the Army. He left for boot camp only days after his mother died of cancer. (Mr. Schulz later suggested that this coincidence might have been the reason for his lifelong hatred of travel.) During World War II, from 1943 to 1945, Mr. Schulz served in France and Germany and became a staff sergeant in the 20th Armored Division. He once refused to toss a grenade into an artillery emplacement because he saw a little dog wander into it.\\nAfter the war he tried various odd jobs: lettering the comics at a Catholic magazine called Timeless Topix; drawing a weekly cartoon called ''Li'l Folks,'' the precursor to ''Peanuts,'' for the St. Paul Pioneer Press; and selling occasional spot cartoons to The Saturday Evening Post.\\nHe also taught at Art Instruction Inc. There he fell in love with a redhead, Donna Johnson, and proposed marriage. She turned him down and married a fireman instead. He never forgot. Ms. Johnson became the Little Red-Haired Girl, Charlie Brown's unrequited love, who was often talked about but never seen in the strip. Mr. Schulz married Joyce Halverson in 1949; the marriage ended in divorce.\\n''You can't create humor out of happiness,'' Mr. Schulz said in his 1980 book, ''Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Me.''\\n''I'm astonished at the number of people who write to me saying, 'Why can't you create happy stories for us? Why does Charlie Brown always have to lose? Why can't you let him kick the football?' Well, there is nothing funny about the person who gets to kick the football.''\\nThe strip's start was bittersweet. In 1949 Mr. Schulz submitted some of his ''Li'l Folks'' comic strips to United Feature Syndicate. The syndicate liked the strip but insisted on calling it ''Peanuts'' because ''Li'l Folks'' was too similar to the name of another strip. ''I was very upset with the title,'' Mr. Schulz once said, ''and still am.''\\nOn Oct. 2, 1950, the first ''Peanuts'' strip was published. It depicted two children sitting on the sidewalk discussing Charlie Brown: ''Well, here comes ol' Charlie Brown!'' . . . ''Good ol' Charlie Brown'' . . . ''Yes, sir! Good ol' Charlie Brown.'' And then, as Charlie Brown passes them, ''How I hate him!''\\nThat year seven newspapers bought ''Peanuts,'' and Mr. Schulz earned $90 a week in royalties. But by 1953 the cartoon was a hit and he was earning $30,000 a year. In 1955 (and again in 1964) the National Cartoonists Society awarded Mr. Schulz the Reuben for being the outstanding cartoonist of the year. He received the Yale Humor Award in 1956 and the School Bell Award from the National Education Association in 1960.\\nUnrequited Love With Roots in Real Life\\n''Peanuts'' was based on repetition and predictability. As Mr. Schulz put it, ''All the loves in the strip are unrequited; all the baseball games are lost; all the test scores are D-minuses; the Great Pumpkin never comes; and the football is always pulled away.'' One of the few innovations Mr. Schulz introduced was allowing Snoopy (after eight years) to stand on two feet and to have his thoughts written out in balloons.\\nSnoopy could always be counted on to nap, fantasize and wonder when his next meal would arrive. Charlie Brown, the round-headed blockhead (named after one of Mr. Schulz's childhood friends, not after the cartoonist himself), could always be counted on to persevere despite constant failure. He once held onto the string of a kite that was stuck in a tree for eight days running, until the rain made him stop. At the time it was the longest run of immobility for any cartoon character. His first home run came after nearly 43 years of strike outs, on March 30, 1993.\\nNo adult ever appeared in ''Peanuts,'' though in television specials there were occasional wah-wah sounds denoting the voices of teachers and parents. As Mr. Schulz once put it, ''Well, there just isn't room for them.'' Curses never got worse than ''Aaugh!'' ''Good grief,'' ''Rats!'' ''Curse you, Red Baron!'' or a knot of lines scrunched up in frustration.\\nThe strips were just the beginning. In 1952 Mr. Schulz started turning out ''Peanuts'' books: ''Peanuts,'' ''More Peanuts,'' ''Good Grief, More Peanuts!'' ''Good Ol' Charlie Brown,'' ''Happiness Is a Warm Puppy'' and dozens more. New compilations rolled off the presses every year for decades.\\nEventually ''Peanuts'' was translated into Serbo-Croatian, Malay, Chinese, Tlingit, Catalan and 15 other languages. Books came out with titles like, ''Het Grote Snoopy Winterspelletjes-Boek'' and ''Du Bist Sub, Charlie Braun.''\\nThe 1960's brought animated ''Peanuts'' television specials. The first was ''A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' which Mr. Schulz wrote in one weekend with Lee Mendelson. Accompanied by Vince Guaraldi's jazz piano, animated by Bill Melendez and unassisted by any laugh track, ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' was shown on CBS in 1965 (and still runs every winter). It won an Emmy and a Peabody. Many more television specials followed, including ''It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.'' Five of the specials won Emmys. There were also ''Peanuts'' feature films, including ''A Boy Named Charlie Brown.''\\nThe takeoffs came rolling in. In 1966 the Royal Guardsmen wrote a rock song, ''Snoopy and the Red Baron.'' In 1967 a musical, ''You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' was produced Off Broadway. (A 1999 revival on Broadway won two Tony Awards.) ''Peanuts Gallery,'' a concerto, was composed by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich and had its premiere at Carnegie Hall in 1997. Mr. Schulz received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture. In 1990 his work was shown at the Louvre; the gala had Snoopys in couture.\\nMany pundits tried to put their finger on the ''Peanuts'' spell and they generally rambled on in a vaguely philosophical vein. Umberto Eco, who wrote the introduction to the first Italian ''Peanuts'' book, referred to Mr. Schulz's work as ''poesie interrompue,'' or interrupted poetry, and, using Freud, Beckett, Adler and Thomas Mann to back him up, said, ''These children affect us because in a certain sense they are monsters; they are the monstrous infantile reductions of all the neuroses of a modern citizen of the industrial civilization.''\\nIn an essay called ''Peanuts: The Americanization of Augustine,'' Arthur Asa Berger, a scholar of popular culture, observed that Mr. Schulz was ''a mirthful moralist'' and a master of Freudian humor, humor that ''serves to mask aggression.''\\nMr. Berger called Snoopy ''an existential hero in every sense of the term,'' a dog who ''strives, with dogged persistence and unyielding courage, to overcome what seems to be his fate -- that he is a dog.'' He is ''a bon vivant, he participates in history, he has an incredible imagination, he is witty, he expresses himself with virtuosity in any number of ways (eye movements, ear movements, tail movements, wisecracks, facial expressions) and he is superb as mimic and dancer.''\\nThe most concerted attempt to bring ''Peanuts'' to heel philosophically came in the 1960's when Robert L. Short, a minister, wrote two books on ''Peanuts'' theology, ''The Gospel According to Peanuts'' (1964) and ''The Parables of Peanuts'' (1968). The Rev. Short saw signs of original sin in the ''Peanuts'' children, who were unable ''to produce any radical change for the better in themselves -- or in each other.'' He saw ''the hazard of worshiping deities'' demonstrated in Linus's belief in the Great Pumpkin. And he called Snoopy ''a typical Christian,'' a flawed character who is nonetheless good: ''He is lazy, he is a 'chow hound' without parallel, he is bitingly sarcastic, he is frequently a coward,'' Mr. Short wrote. But he is ''a hound of heaven.''\\nIf the ''Peanuts'' characters left themselves open to the maunderings of philosophers, ministers and analysts, they were even more vulnerable to toy, card, book and clothing manufacturers.\\nThe licensing madness began in 1958 when the first plastic Snoopy and Charlie Brown came out. In 1960 Hallmark began printing ''Peanuts'' cards and party goods. Then came sweatshirts and pajamas, thermoses and lunch boxes. Plush Snoopy came in 1965. Woodstock slippers, Lucy picture frames, Charlie Brown music boxes followed. Mr. Schulz vetted all products for appropriateness and rejected some: baby wipes for aesthetic reasons, ashtrays, vitamins, sugary breakfast cereals, ice skates and tennis rackets.\\nThere were commercials too. In 1957 the ''Peanuts'' characters started selling Ford Falcons. For 15 years they worked for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Snoopy was the official mascot of NASA, and in 1969 NASA's lunar excursion module on the Apollo 11 mission was called Snoopy. The command module was Charlie Brown.\\nA Menagerie Of Merchandising\\nBy 1999 there were 20,000 different new products each year adorned by ''Peanuts'' characters. In 1994 Mr. Schulz was inducted into the Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association Hall of Fame. Jim Davis, the creator of the cartoon ''Garfield,'' who is no stranger to commercialization, said, ''Schulz created the industry as far as cartooning and licensing go.''\\nWhen asked whether he minded his characters selling merchandise, Mr. Schulz said, ''I don't think there's such a thing as going commercial with a comic strip because a comic strip is a commercial right from the beginning.'' It is there to sell newspapers, he said.\\nIn 1989 Forbes listed the cartoonist among the ten wealthiest entertainers, earning $32 million a year.\\nNonetheless his lifestyle remained simple. Mr. Schulz, who hated to travel, said he would have been happy living his whole life in Minneapolis. But ''I had a restless first wife,'' so they moved to Sebastopol, Calif., and he set up his studio in Santa Rosa. In 1969, after the local ice rink closed, he and his wife, Joyce, built a new one, the Redwood Empire Ice Skating Arena. ''Because of Snoopy's hockey playing,'' Mr. Schulz explained, ''I have to keep in the game. So I bought an arena.''\\nCharles and Joyce Schulz had five children, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1972. He said, ''I don't think she liked me anymore, and I just got up and left one day.'' A year later he met Jeannie Clyde at the ice rink and married her.\\nMr. Schulz's workday typically began with a trip in his Mercedes (license plate WDSTK1, after Woodstock) down from the hills near where he lived, breakfast at the ice rink's Warm Puppy Snack Bar, a trip to his stone-and-redwood studio at One Snoopy Place to draw his strip, lunch at the ice rink, more work in the afternoon in his studio and dinner at a restaurant with his wife.\\nWhile his small staff dealt with the commercial end of the business, he attended only to drawing. He used a yellow legal pad for sketching and drew with an Esterbrook Radial pen. He would start doodling until something funny happened. He never took suggestions from anyone (though he did draw on conversations, newspapers, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, and his children's antics.\\n''Drawing a daily comic strip is not unlike having an English theme hanging over your head every day for the rest of your life,'' he once said. He could do a strip an hour and six strips a day, but preferred not to. He generally kept three months ahead of publication and never took more than ten days off at a time, and then only reluctantly.\\n''Peanuts'' continued to appear when Mr. Schulz had quadruple-bypass heart surgery in 1981. And it was only under orders from United Feature that he took off for five weeks in 1997 for his 75th birthday.\\nJeannie Schulz once said that all the characters in ''Peanuts'' are parts of her husband. ''He's crabby like Lucy, diffident like Charlie Brown. There's a lot of Linus -- he's philosophical and wondering about life.'' Like Schroeder, he loved classical music, though he preferred Brahms to Beethoven. And like Snoopy, he was a war buff. Snoopy had all of World War I covered. But Mr. Schulz knew all the World War II battlegrounds and was the head of a capital fund-raising campaign for the National D-Day Memorial.\\nHe was a member of the Church of God, where he was a Sunday school teacher and administrator and would occasionally deliver the Sunday sermon.\\nPeople described Mr. Schulz as looking like a druggist. He found Garry Trudeau's ''Doonesbury'' and Walt Kelly's ''Pogo'' too political, but he admired the work of Cathy Guisewite, the cartoonist who draws ''Cathy,'' and Ms. Johnston, of ''For Better or for Worse.'' His favorite ice cream flavor was vanilla.\\nMr. Schulz is survived by his wife, a philanthropist, and his children: Meredith Hodges, who raises mules in Loveland, Colo.; Charles Jr. (called Monte), a novelist in Nevada City, Calif.; Craig, a private pilot in Santa Rosa; Amy Johnson, a homemaker with nine children in Alpine, Utah; and Jill Schulz Transki, who runs an in-line skating business with her husband in Santa Barbara, Calif. He is also survived by two stepchildren, Brooke Clyde, a lawyer in Santa Rosa, and Lisa Brockway, a homemaker in Ashland, Oregon; and 18 grandchildren.\\nPersonal Anxieties Shared With Millions\\nDespite his large family and large success he was a melancholy man who worried and was often lonely, depressed and plagued by panic attacks, features that Rheta Grimsley Johnson brought out in her 1989 biography ''Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz.'' Sally, Charlie Brown's sister, put it well in a school report on night and day: ''Daytime is so you can see where you're going. Nighttime is so you can lie in bed worrying.''\\nMr. Schulz had a white terrier named Andy, played golf (12 handicap), tennis (for a while with Billie Jean King) and bridge. But he was most devoted to hockey and ice skating. He was a right-handed shot.\\nHe hated cats, coconut and sleeping away from home. And he never forgot a slight. Ms. Johnston once said, ''He's bitter about the little red-haired girl who didn't marry him, he's bitter about his divorce, he's bitter about getting old.'' And he was bitter about the lack of recognition cartoonists get. This is what he said about cartooning: ''It will destroy you. It will break your heart.''\\nThe creator of one of the least troubled dogs of all time, Mr. Schulz compared his own panic to that of a dog ''running frantically down the road pursuing the family car.'' The dog ''is not really being left behind,'' he said, ''but for that moment in his limited understanding, he is being left alone forever.''\\nAs Mr. Schulz got older he began to think about the end of his strip. His hand quavered, but he knew that he did not want anyone else to draw the cartoon. ''Everything has to end,'' he once said. ''This is my excuse for existence. No one else will touch it.'' In November he was hospitalized for colon cancer and started chemotherapy. On Dec. 14 he announced that his strip would end. But thoughts of death had long since seeped into his strip. ''After you've died, do you get to come back?'' Linus once asked Charlie Brown. He replied, ''If they stamp your hand.''\\nMr. Schulz always felt for the little man and the little animal. He once said that his philosophy of life could be found in the Gospel of St. Luke: ''It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.''\\nIntertwined Lives: Complex 'Peanuts' Personalities and Their Creator\\nCharlie Brown\\nAlso known as Blockhead, Good Ol' Charlie Brown, Chuck, Charles and Mr. Sack (which he was briefly called when he wore a sack over his head at camp to cover up a rash that looked like the stitching on a baseball).\\nFirst appearance Oct. 2, 1950.\\nNamed for Charles M.

'') Battled the Red Baron from his Sopwith Camel doghouse, beginning on Oct. 10, 1965, often shouting his fighting words, ''Curse you, Red Baron.''\\nOccupations Surgeon (in order to wear green booties), artist, lawyer, beagle scout with bird troop, skating coach and, beginning on July 12, 1965, novelist (published ''It Was a Dark and Stormy Night'' in 1971) and more than 100 other roles.\\nTraits Epicurean, worldly, debonair, confident, fanciful, insistent about supper.\\nLucy Van Pelt\\nAlso known as Fussbudget and once called ''Crab grass on the lawn of life'' by Linus.\\nFirst appearance March 3, 1952.\\nInspiration Mr. Schulz's daughter Meredith.

Up until as recent as a years ago it was generally believed that the first comic book was a reprint collection of the first comic strip, best known as the Yellow Kid.\\nThere have been recent discoveries proving that comic books were around long before the Yellow Kid. This new age of comics is being called the \"Victorian Age\" for now.\\nWith this webpage I\\'m trying to stick to comic books rather than single panel drawings or comic strips in newspapers. Those things I may expand to after I\\'m somewhat satisfied I have the comic book history nailed down.\\nToday the earliest known comic book is called The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck. Originally published in several languages in Europe in 1837, among them an English version designed for Britain in 1941. A year later it was that version reprinted in New York on Sept. 14, 1842 for Americans, making it the first comic book  printed in America. Odadiah Oldbuck is 40 pages long and measured 8 �\" x 11\". The book  was side stitched, and inside there were 6 to 12 panels per page. No word balloons, but there is text  under the panels to describe the story. A copy of it was discovered in Oakland, California in 1998.\\nThe comic was done by Switzerland\\'s Rudolphe Töpffer, who has been considered in Europe (and starting to become here in America) as the creator of the picture story. He created the comic strip in 1827 and the comic book/graphic novel. Rudolphe Töpffer created several (7 is known) graphic novels that were extremely successful and reprinted in many different languages, several of them had English versions in America in 1846. The books remained in print in America until 1877. There are an unknown amount of Victorian Age Comic Books, this era of comic book history is still being discovered, researched and recorded. When more information is available I\\'ll be writing about this as well.\\nAn influential illustrated book to come out in this period was called The Brownies: Their Book. The Brownies feature wasn\\'t really a comic book per say. They were created by Palmer Cox and originally part of a children\\'s magazine called St. Nicholas. The Brownies first appeared in the magazine in 1883 in a story called The Brownies\\' Ride. The Brownies were heavily merchandised and one of the products they put out was book featuring their illustrations with a text story beside the pictures. The Brownies: Their Book was first published in 1887 and several other books involving the same characters followed afterwards. It is likely to be the first North American Comic to be internationally successful.\\nBesides St. Nicholas, there were other magazines using picture stories of sorts and they were getting popular. Among the magazines were Harper\\'s, Puck, Judge, Life and Truth. Newspapers began to recognize their growing popularity and added a Sunday Comics feature to cash in. The newspapers couldn\\'t get the popular artists and their characters because the Magazines already had them signed up. But a Puck staff member, Roy L. McCardell told Morrill Goddard, the Sunday editor of The New York World (then largest newspaper) that he knew someone who could provide something.\\nThat someone was Richard F. Outcault. He did a picture of street children in the June 2nd, 1894 edition of Truth. You can see the Yellow Kid (without yellow) is in the picture at the bottom right and plays a minor role. The caption underneath it would read:\\nFeudal Pride in Hogan\\'s Alley\\nLittle Rosilla McGraw -- No; we won\\'t come and play with you, Delia Costigan. Our rejuced means may temporary necessitate our residin\\' in a rear tenement, but we\\'re jist as exclusive as when we lived on the first floor front and papa had charge of the pound in the Department of Canine Captivity!\\nAfterwards, Outcault would do four more for the Truth magazine the last one was is a homage to Palmer Cox\\'s The Brownies. Originally published on the 9th of February 1895, titled Fourth Ward Brownies. It was reprinted in the newspapers shortly afterwards.\\nOutcault would come to the newspaper and create Hogan\\'s Alley, best known for it\\'s unnamed staring character, whom New Yorkers dubbed, the Yellow Kid. It is believed that Outcault got his inspiration from a number of different sources. Among them were the cartoons of Michael Angelo Woolf and Charles W. Saalburg cartoons that used street kids. The title Hogan\\'s Alley could have come from the song \"O\\'Reilly and the Four Hundred\" which stats off singing \"Down in Hogan\\'s Alley.\"\\nThe Platinum Age 1897 - 1938\\nEarly 1897 a book called The Yellow Kid in McFadden\\'s Flats came out. The comic was 196 pages long, square bound, black and white, 50 cents and 5 �\" x 7 �\". It was published by G. W. Dillingham Company with permission from Hearst, the newspaper that had Hogan\\'s Alley at the time. It was a part of a series that Dillingham did on American Authors, only he took special liberties with this one and created what is today known as a comic book. In fact this comic that coined the phrase \"Comic Book\" as it\\'s written on the back cover. Inside we get an origin of sorts as it reprints the earliest Yellow Kid\\'s appearances. There is some text within by E. W. Townsend explaining Outcault and the Kid. This comic book starts what is now called the Platinum Age of Comics.\\nIn 1899 a Funny Folks comic book came out, taking a close first stab at a format for many Platinum Age comic books. The book was hardcover, 16 �\" wide by 12\" tall. Funny Folks was created by F. M. Howarth, but published by E. P. Dutton. It was a black and white collection of reprints from the Puck magazine.\\nIn 1901 The Blackberries came out and is the first known full color comic book. It used a format of 9\" x 12\" and was a hardcover book.\\nThen the most often used format of 17\" wide x 11 tall\" began being used by a number of comic books. Among them The Katzenjammer Kids, Little Nemo and Happy Hooligan. After the Yellow Kid, Outcault would create many other strips and characters. One of them also ended up in comic book form. That was Buster Brown, published in 1902 by Cupples & Leon. Thanks to the merchandising success of Buster Brown, many companies made Buster Brown comics as premiums to sell their stuff. Most of these comics were full color, but with only reprinted Sunday comics on one side of the page. They were large volumes and were priced at 50 cents. This format lasted over a decade.\\nIn 1910 Mutt & Jeff created a new format, reprinting daily strips in black and white. The book was still a hardcover, but was 15\" wide x 5\" tall. It was published by Ball and they did 5 volumes of Mutt & Jeff books.\\nThen in 1919, Publisher Cupples & Leon used a different format. They were 10\" by 10\" with 4 panels per page, each page. They were black and white, 52 pages for 25 cents. Titles and characters used for these books was Mutt & Jeff and Bringing up Father.\\nIn 1922 the first monthly comic book came out. It was cover dated January and had a price of 10 cents. They were done in 8 � by 9 format. The title was Comics Monthly and lasted 12 issues. Each issue was devoted to a popular comic strip character that was syndicated by King Features. Issue #1 and #12 was Polly and her Pals. #2 was Mike & Ike by Rube Goldberg. #3 - S\\'Matter Pop? #4 - Barney Google. #5 - Tillie the Toiler. #6 - Indoor Sports. #7 - Little Jimmy. #8 Toots and Casper. #9 & 10- Foolish Questions. #11 Barney Google and Spark Plug. These were all reprints of 1921 daily black and white strips.\\nIn 1926 Little Orphan Annie and Smitty comics came out in a 7 by 9 format, published by Cupples and Leon. They were printed in both softcover and Hardcover with dust jackets. They were very popular with a 60 cents price.\\nIn 1929 Dell Publishing took a crack at a regular Comic Book. The comic was called The Funnies and was done in a big tabloid-sized format. They were 16 pages and sold for 10 cents. It was distributed by the newsstands along with newspapers. Unlike Comic Monthly, this book was done 4 colours and had original comic strips instead of reprints. A new issue came out every Saturday, but it lost money. Issues #3 to #21 were 30 cents each. The price changed to 5 cents with issue #22 and lasted the final issue with #36.\\nWalt Disney got into comic books too. The earliest of these was Mickey Mouse Book. Done in 1930 - 31, published by Bibo & Lang. These were 9\"x12\", 20 pages long and stapled together. Despite the title of \"book\" this was in fact a magazine, inside it had a variety of songs, games and stories. There were later printings of this book but some lyrics were edited, advertising was inserted and christmas card was a part of the front cover.\\nThe Adventures of Mickey Mouse is considered to be the first \"true\" Mickey Mouse comic book. It came out in 1931, is 32 pages long and 5 -1/2\" x 8 1/2\". It was published by David McKay Co. with a print run of 50,000 copies. There were both hardcover and softcover versions of this book. A second book came out after the Mickey Mouse cartoons and the characters within were made similar to the cartoons.\\nMickey Mouse Comic #1 also came out in 1931. It reprints the Mickey Mouse comic strips done by Floyd Gottfredson from 1930 to 1931. It measures 10\"x 9 3/4\" is 52 pages long with a cardboard cover. The series lasted 4 issues with later reprintings. It was also published by David McKay Co.\\nThere were two different Mickey Mouse Magazines done in 1933. The first in January published by Kamen-Blair. It was distributed by daries and local theaters. It lasted until issue #9, the first few issues had a 5 cent cover price, the later ones did not. The second was also give aways done through different Dairie companies. It had two volumes, the both going 12 issues. Both magazines were done by Walt Disney Productions and they ended in 1935. In the summer of the same year A new Mickey Mouse Magazine was done by publisher K. K. Publishing AKA Western Publishing Co.. Like the previous incarnation, this magazine would run 12 issues, then restart back at #1 with another volume. This continued for 5 years, with #12 volume 4 converted to a more traditional comic book format. It turned 68 pages and shrank to normal comic book size. It then went under a title change to Walt Disney Comics & Stories. I\\'ll discuss that when we get to that point and time.\\nNot all comics were squeaky clean and sold on newsstands. From about the 1930\\'s to the 1950\\'s small dirty comics were sold through underground means. These were called Tijuana Bibles, despite the name they were made in America. While much of their origins or artists are not known it\\'s believed they were made by members of organized crime. This is partialy because the bibles were illegally using trademarked characters. Well known comic strips, movies stars, sport celeberties and more had their likeness used to tell dirty stories with. The book shown here is a collection of Tijuana Bibles. If you are over 18 and you want to see examples of some Tijuana bibles, click here and here .\\nIn 1933, Detective Dan, Secret Op. 48 was the first comic, sold on the newsstands, with original material in it. Done by Norman Marsh this comic had a 3 color, cardboard cover. Inside was black and white. Sold for 10cents, dimensions were 10x13\". It had 36 pages and was only a one shot published by Humor Publishers Corp., The Detective Dan character was a Dick Tracy clone, and didn\\'t last very long. There was some other appearances by him though. One in The Adventures of Detective Ace King. Also done in 1933. There are some minor differences between the two books, among them a paper cover and pages 9 1/2 x12\".\\nFree Comics became popular in the early 1930\\'s. This was mainly because of the depression and deflation. It also kept the publishing presses running during very hard times. Shutting down and starting up the printing presses cost time and money and the presses did everything they could to keep them going. Thousands of different comics were given away as companies used popular comic strips for advertising purposes. The pioneers of this trend is given to Sam Gold and Kay Kamen. Among the most well known giveaways are Kelloggs Buck Rogers and Ovaltine\\'s Little Orphan Annie.\\nEastern Color Printing Company was one company that became very important in formation of comic industry. They had a 45 year old sales manager named Harry I. Wildenberg, among his duties were to come up with ideas to keep the color presses going. In 1932 he noticed the color comic strips sections of newspapers were popular and thought they would be good for advertising.\\nHe suggested the idea of a comic book used for advertising to Gulf Oil Company, one of his clients. They liked the idea and hired a few artists to create Gulf Comic Weekly among them were Stan Schendel who did The Uncovered Wagon, Victor (last name unknown) did Curly and the Kids and Svess (last name unknown) doing Smileage. These were one full page, full color comic pictures. The entire comic was 4 pages long and had a format of 10 � by 15. The comic was given away at Gulf Gas Stations making them probably the first comic book published and distributed outside of the newspaper market. The comic was advertised on radio (telling people to go to Gulf Gas stations to get them) on April 30th 1933.\\nMuch to everybodys surprise, the comics proved an very effective draw to the gas stations. People were quickly coming in and snatching them all up. Gulf decided to print out 3 million copies a week had the name changed to Comics Funnies Weekly. The series remained in tabloid sized and lasted 422 issues, ending on May 23, 1941.\\nA few weeks after coming up with the tabloid sized comic book, Wildenberg came up with the idea of doing a comic book. He said he got it when reading a tabloid sized comic strip page, folded it in half, then in half again. He noticed it was a convenient size for reading comics. He also thought publishing it with 32 or 64 pages would be a good size.\\nWildenberg wasn\\'t the first to use this format though. From 1880\\'s to 1910\\'s the size was popular for reprinted comic pages. Pulp Dime Novels were already using that size and the Ledger Syndicate was also using 7 by 9 format for their Sunday newspaper comic strip inserts.\\nConvinced his idea would be popular Wildenberg secured the rights from many major Syndicates for to reprint their various comic strips. Among them, Associated, Bell, Fisher, McNaught and Public Ledger Syndicate. He had an artist make up a few hand make comics for demonstration purposes and then has his sales staff go around to all of Eastern Color\\'s biggest advertisers. The first to respond (by telegram) was Procter and Gamble, asking for a million 32 page color comic book.\\nThe comic published in the spring of 1933, was called Funnies on Parade. Most remarkable about was it set a format standard, using the same 8\" x 11\" format that comic books are printed in today. All 1 million copies were given away in a few weeks. The comic came with coupons for Proctor & Gamble products.\\nDoing the grunt work of publishing the comic went to Wildenbergs sales staff. Most of them were infected by the comic publishing bug after this issue and went on to continue with comics afterwards. The sales staff included Max Gaines (partnered with DC to create All American Comics imprint and started EC), Lev Gleason (became a publisher himself best known for starting the crime comics genre with Crime Does Not Pay) and Harold Moore. Also working on the project was Sol Harrison was the colour seperator (became DC Comics President - retired in 1980), George Dougherty Sr. was the printer (created a lived George Dougherty Co. comics company). Morris Margolis was from Charlton Publications, and was asked to help them figure out how to print the pages in order.\\nFamous Funnies: a Carnival of Comics was the second comic book done by the Eastern Color group. Printed in 1933, it was 64 pages with a 10 cent price. It was the first retail comic that was distributed to the public as it was given away only through chain department stores. Eastern Color Printing worked together on creating it and got George Delacorte of Dell Publishing to publish the book. After the first issue, Dell Publishing (not seeing any profit) decided to stop publishing the comic.\\nM.C. Gaines sought to convince his boss Wildenberg that they could make money selling these comics on the newsstand. Wildenberg had a hard time believing that anyone would pay for a comic book. To prove his point , Gaines took a few of issues around, put 10 cent stickers on them and went to local newsstands over the weekend. He told the newsstands what he was testing to see if these could sell and that he\\'d be back Monday to see how they were doing. Monday came around and to his surprise, they had all sold out and the newsstands were asking for more.\\nOther freebie comics done were the 100 page Century of Comics and Skippy\\'s Own Book of Comics. Skippy was a very popular comic character and was the first to receive his own \"new\" comic dedicated comic series. Each of these had a print run of a half a million. From there Wildenberg was really interested in publishing a \"higher level\" of a comic book with reprints of famous comic strips, sold for 10 cents. He tried to get many companies to hop on but none would. Among those to turn him down were Oscar Fitz-Alan Douglas known as the brains of Woolsworth department store. After much deliberation he decided a 10 cents wasn\\'t worth a comic book. Many other stores to turn them down, as did Parents Magazine. The just couldn\\'t see anyone paying 10 cents for old comics they already read from the newspapers. They Syndicates didn\\'t see it selling either, they remembered both Comics Monthly and The Funnies trying and failing at selling comic books.\\nFinally Eastern Color owner George Janosik stepped in and asked George Delacourt of Dell Publishing to form a 50/50 partnership in a 10 cent comic magazine for the newsstand. He agreed but the two were stopped cold by the distributor American News Distribution refused as they remembered Dell\\'s The Funnies failure from a few years before. The two then decided to go to the retail chains stores again and got some of them to sell the comics at 10 cents each. Famous Funnies (know called Series One because of duplicate names) used material previously reprinted from the first Famous Funnies and Century of Comics. It was 64 pages, had a print run of 400,000 and they all sold out within 30 days. Not one single returned. Eastern wanted to go back for a second print run but Dell wouldn\\'t agree. Apparently advertisers felt using comic books was beneath them. Still the sold out print run made the two companies $2,000.\\nHarold Moore an employee under Wildenberg was on a train reading an article about a successful New York newspaper that said their Comics Section was responsible for much of their success. Moore then went back to American News president Harry Gold with the newspaper article. He finally agreed to distribute a monthly comic magazine with a print run of 250,000.\\nIn May 1934 (the comic was dated July), another first issue of Famous Funnies appeared on the newsstands. It featured four pages each of several newspaper comic characters. It was 64 pages long but kept the 10 cent price tag. It had a 90% sell though but still lost $4,150.60. A second issue came out in July (cover dated September) and was monthly after that. With the second issue the magazine hired people at 5 dollars a page to create original material for them. Meanwhile it costed the magazine 10 dollars a page for Syndicated reprints. The comic was edited by Steven O. Douglass but Moore got the credit in the first issue. From issue #3 and on Buck Rogers took the center stage and became the comics feature character. By 7th issue, finally a profit emerged as the group made $2,664.25, but it must have been too little, too late as Dell Publishing got cold feat and sold their 50% to Eastern Color. Still, every issue had higher sales, and by a years time sales were up to almost a million per month. How the 10 cents per issue got divided among the parties bounced around as the series progressed. At first Eastern would see 6 of the 10 cents, later it was 6 �. The rest was split between Newsstand and Distributor with the newsstand taking 2 then 2 � cents and American News took 1 then 1 � cents. Eastern proudly made public the amount of money they were making off the comics, as a way of saying \"I told you so\" to the many people rejected the idea at first. They were making $30,000 per issue. They also did this to drum up more business, either as a publisher or printer. By the time a year had gone by Funnies had gained some respect and was placed on newsstands beside slick magazines like Atlantic Monthly and Harper\\'s. They also had 5 competitors putting out monthly magazines. This comic series would last 218 issues ending in 1955.\\nIn 1934, with a cover date of February 1935, New Fun Comics came out. The creator, Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson decided that he didn\\'t want to pay the fees that the newspapers were charging for their old comic strip reprints. So he got new comic material that wasn\\'t being published in the newspapers. National Allied Publications Inc. published New Fun Comics in a much bigger 10\" x 15\" tabloid size. Which was closer to what the news paper comic section was. The cover was full color and was made out of stiff cardboard. Inside about half the book had color in it, but each strip was usually allowed one color only. It is also said that this title is the first to have advertisements inside, while selling on the newsstands. The strips inside were done by a mix of cartoonist veterans struggling during the depression or young cartoonists trying to break in. In fact, some of the new comic material was made by Wheeler-Nicholson himself. Some artists already had completed strips that the syndicates wouldn\\'t take, and they were able to get some money for them by printing them here. Many were knock offs of popular newspaper strips. Out of all the strips only two had any lasting effect, those were Wing Brady and Barry O\\'Neill. The series would last 6 issues before the name would change to More Fun Comics, with issue #9 the format would change to a normal comic book size. Of those contributing strips to the issue would be Walt Kelly and Al Capp who later go on to have great success in the comic strip field. With the help of superheroes, this title would last 127 issues getting cancelled in November 1947. There was a brief time after issue #12 the book would start at #1 again with a volume 2. This last for 5 issues and then switched back to volume 1 returning with the original numbering with issue 18.\\nAfter New Fun Comics, another Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson published another title. This was New Comics (December, 1935) and again it featured all new material. Among the artists who\\'s work featured in here was Walt Kelly, Sheldon Mayer and Vincent Sullivan, all three would be important to the development of comics. The title would go through many name changes, turning into New Adventure Comics with issue #12, then to simply Adventure Comics with issue #32. Like New Fun, the title went through a period of volume 2 with new numbering starting with New Adventure Comics #1, then New Adventure Vol 3 #1 and stopping with Vol. 3 #2, before returning to #22 continuing it\\'s original numbering run. This title with the help of many superhero features would last until 1983, ending with issue #503.\\nLev Gleason would also get a comic strip Syndicate behind him and become the editor of Tip Top Comics #1 with all United Features syndicated comic strips. Under their umbrella was Tarzan, Li\\'l Abner, Broncho Bill, Captain and the Kids and other popular strips. Eventually Peanuts appeared in this series as well. This title also gave us the first published work of Harvey Kurtzman and Jack Davis, both would go on to make EC Comics very popular and successful. The series would also end up becoming one of the first comic book Trade Paper Back, with bound reprints of a number of issue being up for sale at the 1939 Worlds Fair. First set had issues 1-12, second 13-24, the third 25-36. This title would be published by both St. John Publishing and later Dell Publishing, stretching out and last 225 issues ending in 1961.\\nIn February 1936 Chicago Tribune Syndicate teamed up with Max Gaines, his assistant Sheldon Mayer and George Delacorte (his third try at comic books) and created Popular Comics featuring a huge amount of well known characters. Among them, Dick Tracy, Terry & the Pirates, Gasoline Alley, Skippy, Mutt and Jeff, Tailspin Tommy, Little Orphan Annie and many more. The third and final try at comics would be what Delacourte needed to become a successful publisher, in fact Dell Publishing Co. would be one of the most successful comic publishers of all time. This title would last 145 issues and end in 1948.\\nIn April of 1936, another major comic strip syndicate would jump in the comic book business. King Features created King Comics. David McKay was a publisher who had done some comic books through King Features, and he had the job of doing this one with the editor Ruth Plumly Thompson. In it Flash Gordon, Popeye, Mandrake the Magician would be among the popular strips to make their appearance in the first issue. Later on The Lone Ranger, The Phantom, Prince Valiant, Blondie and Little Lulu would be among the other popular strips to appear in the title. The comic would last 159 issues and end in 1952. Out of it would spring Standard Publishing a comic book company with many different titles.\\nA month later two men named William Cook and John Mahon published The Comics Magazine #1. Cook and Mahon were former disgruntled employees of National Allied Publications, owned by Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson - the company that gets later renamed to DC Comics. Cook and Mahon would go on to form a publishing company called Comics Magazine Co. but the title changed and so did the ownership. Eventually it would be called Centaur Comics. The Comics Magazine #1 would feature a character and two creators that go on to become famous. Mr. Mystic was created and done by Siegel and Shuster, the two would go on to create Superman. Mr.Mystic was not in a costume in this issue, but the weird thing was the character would later appear in DC Comics More Fun #14, with the story (called \"The Koth and the Seven\") continuing on from one publishers book to the next. Another Siegel and Shuster character to appear in this title was Federal Agent, later renamed Federal Men when they also appeared in DC Comics. The Comics Magazine would change it\\'s name to Funny Pages with issue #6. The series would feature a character named The Clock, who was the first masked hero in comics. The title would last until 1940 ending with issue #42.\\nBy the end of the year, Centuar Publications would be the first to publish titles devoted to a single theme. They were Detective Picture Stories, Western Picture Stories, and Funny Picture Stories. Despite the title, Funny was about Adventure type stories. Detective Picture Stories would last 5 issues and they would include some work by creators who later become famous like Wil Eisner and Bob Kane. The title may have continued on with another name but the specifics are not known. Funny Picture Stories lasted almost as long, but they did 3 volumes, resetting the numbers back to #1 each time. The 1st went 9 issues, the 2nd went 11 issues (#6 being the first with the Centuar Comics name on it) and the 3rd lasted 3 issues before the title gets renamed to Comic Pages from #4 and up. This series also had work from people who later become famous, among them Charles Biro and Bob Wood best known for Crime Does Not Pay comic, and Fred Guardineer who did a lot of work for DC Comics. Lastly, Western Picture Stories lasted 4 issues. All with Wil Eisner work in them.\\nIn March 1937, Detective Comics #1 came out. This comic was the first true DC comic book. This issue was the first production of two companies that formed the DC company. Comic producer Major Malcolm Wheeler wasn\\'t making much money with his comic books (New Fun being one of them) and owed money to his printer and just about everybody else. Wheeler was forced to collaborated with his printer/distributor Harry Donenfeld to produce this book. Most of the stories in this issue are racist towards Chineese people and they are the villains in the majority of the tales. One such story titled \"Claws of the Red Dragon\" writen by Major Malcolm Wheeler. Another story of note in here is called Slam Bradley done by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The character looks very similar to another they created. That being Superman. From the opening splash page to the different layouts to the tough guy hero saves the girls it\\'s easy to see how there style paved the way for the typical comic hero story.\\nBy 1938, Donenfeld, bought out Wheeler\\'s other books to become the sole owner. He then took on a friend/accountant in his distribution business, Jack Liebowitz as a partner. The company was renamed National Periodical Publications. Liebowitz stayed at the offices and headed the accounting and creative part of DC, while Donnenfeld handled and expanded the distribution though his company Independent News Co.. Donnenfeld remained president of DC until his death in 1965. Liebowitz remained in DC until 1970 and later moved to the Board of Directors of the Warner Brothers company. He died in 2000. Detective Comics is the DC\\'s longest running comic book title, this is due to another character who took over the about 2 years later.\\nComics On Parade #1 by United Feature Syndicate. April 1938, goes to #104 1955. First issue featured Tarzan by Hal Foster, Captain and the Kids, Little Mary Mixup, Abbie & Slats, Ella Cinders, Broncho Bill, and Li\\'l Abner.\\nA few months later a new comic would come out that change the comic industry forever. Up until now, most comics were made for adult readers. This new comic showed that you can make a lot more money by marketing comics to kids.', 'Snoopy | Peanuts Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\\nAndy Beall\\nDaniel Davies (2008)\\n\"Snoopy’s whole personality is a little bittersweet. But he’s a very strong character. He can win or lose, be a disaster, a hero, or anything, and yet it all works out. I like the fact that when he’s in real trouble, he can retreat into a fantasy and thereby escape.\"\\nCharles M. Schulz on Snoopy\\nSnoopy is the iconic deuteragonist of the Peanuts comic strip by Charles M. Schulz . He is the pet beagle of Charlie Brown who owns and cares for him. Snoopy is blessed with a rich, Walter Mitty -like fantasy life.\\nIn most of the Peanuts television specials, Snoopy is voiced by Bill Melendez . Andy Beall voiced Snoopy in Happiness Is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown , following Melendez\\'s death in 2008. Recordings of Melendez were used to create Snoopy\\'s voice in The Peanuts Movie .\\nAlong with Charlie Brown, Snoopy is the only other character to appear in every movie and special.\\nContents\\n[ show ]\\nBackground\\nSnoopy first appeared in the October 4, 1950 strip, two days after the strip began. Schulz originally planned to call him \"Sniffy\", but found out that name was used in a different comic strip. He then changed the dog\\'s name to Snoopy. The name first appeared on November 10, 1950 .\\nPeanuts comic strip from February 2, 1951.\\nIn the early days, it was unclear who was the owner of Snoopy. It was not necessarily Charlie Brown. For instance, in the strip from February 2, 1951 , Charlie Brown yells at Snoopy for following him, until\\xa0 Patty \\xa0tells him that Snoopy is not following him, but simply lives in the same direction. Other early strips show Snoopy on a leash with Shermy or Patty, and not Charlie Brown. However, other early strips show Snoopy in Charlie Brown\\'s room at night, as he is going to sleep. It seems that in the early days of the strip, Snoopy was an ownerless dog who played with the various children. As the years went by, Snoopy began to interact with Charlie Brown more often than the other children. It is eventually shown that Snoopy\\'s doghouse is in Charlie Brown\\'s backyard, and Charlie Brown is responsible for feeding him. It is eventually confirmed that Charlie Brown is the owner, when he says that his parents bought\\xa0Snoopy for him, when he was upset, after a boy dumped a bucket of sand on him in a sandbox.\\nSnoopy has some little bird friends , the most loyal of which is Woodstock . Snoopy also has seven siblings, Spike , Belle , Marbles , Olaf , Andy , and two others named in the special Snoopy\\'s Reunion as Molly and Rover . The eight puppies were born at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm . Snoopy has recalled his family going to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm\\'s chapel every day, and being part of a fifty-beagle choir. He also taught Sunday school there, a fact Charlie Brown sometimes forgets. He went to school at the Ace Obedience School .\\nLinus tells Charlie Brown about Snoopy\\'s first owner Lila in the strip from August 30, 1968.\\nAccording to a series of comic strips from August 1968 and the movie, Snoopy Come Home , at an early age, Snoopy was taken in by a girl named Lila , but when she was unable to keep him, he was returned to the farm, where Charlie Brown picked him up. This fact came to light when Lila was in the hospital and wrote to Snoopy, asking him to come and visit her. Linus did some research and learned of this, sharing his information with Charlie Brown when Snoopy returned.\\nSnoopy appears to like Charlie Brown. Once when Charlie Brown came home from camp, Snoopy made a welcome home banner and was waiting outside Charlie Brown\\'s house with cake. However, the banner said \"Welcome home, Round-headed Kid.\" Snoopy often refers to Charlie Brown as \"the Round-Headed Kid\" not out of spite, but simply because he could not remember his name.\\nSnoopy imitates a bird in the strip from August 9, 1951.\\nSnoopy has a broad and vivid fantasy life, often delving into many alter egos.\\nSnoopy has done many impressions over the years. His earliest impression (that of a bird) was seen on August 9, 1951 . Starting on November 17, 1955 , his impressions began to be somewhat prominent: He did impressions of Violet , a pelican, Lucy , a moose, Beethoven and Mickey Mouse. He would also pretend to be other animals, including a snake, rhinoceros, lion, and vulture. But his eccentricities did not stop there.\\nSnoopy first appears as the World War I Flying Ace in the Sunday strip from October 10, 1965.\\nThe most famous of his role plays is The World War I Flying Ace . When assuming this personality, Snoopy dons goggles, a flying helmet and a scarf, and climbs on top of his doghouse (which he claims is a Sopwith Camel ). He calls his imaginary enemy the Red Baron .\\nAnother well-known imaginary role is \" Joe Cool \", in which Snoopy puts on a \"cool\" look by putting on sunglasses and leaning against a wall doing nothing.\\nSnoopy has also imagined himself as a self-proclaimed \"famous\" writer \\xa0(although his extremely short \"novels\" are never published, and the two-paragraph one that managed to get published failed to sell), a bow tie-wearing attorney (who once defended Peter Rabbit), a hockey player , an Olympic figure skater (who used to skate with Peggy Fleming before he became \"big time\"), and as a world famous grocery checkout clerk who operated from the top of his doghouse in an apron. He also imagined himself as an astronaut , claiming to be the first beagle on the moon in his delusional dreams.\\nRelationships\\nSee main article: Charlie Brown and Snoopy\\'s relationship\\nSnoopy is Charlie Brown\\'s dog, he and Charlie Brown both like each other, but sometimes it seems like Snoopy does not appreciate Charlie Brown, he only seems to at times appreciate the fact Charlie Brown feeds him and gets upset easily if Charlie Brown brings his supper just a few minutes late, even though Charlie Brown brings him food everyday. In one strip Charlie Brown had to go to hospital, Snoopy initially did not care very much until he finds out he will not be getting any supper. Snoopy also does not appreciate the jokes Charlie Brown sometimes makes when he brings Snoopy his food, at one point he even throws the supper dish at Charlie Brown.\\nBut there are many occasions where Snoopy shows his love for Charlie Brown, On one occasion when Charlie Brown returns from camp, Snoopy makes him a welcome home sign (Although it says \"Welcome home \\'Round Header Kid\\'\"). He also gets very excited when Charlie Brown returns from School, and sometimes does a dance and hugs Charlie Brown when he gets home. In one storyline, when Charlie Brown and his family go on vacation, he has to leave Snoopy with Linus and Lucy , Snoopy cries the whole time until Charlie Brown returns. In the strip from October 9, 1971, Snoopy joins Charlie Brown in walking out of a game of Ha-Ha Herman when Peppermint Patty crudely insults Charlie Brown (although she is unaware that Charlie Brown was within earshot when she insults him). He also helps Charlie Brown recover his autographed baseball when a bully takes it and challenges Charlie Brown to to fight for it. In a storyline where Charlie Brown leaves school and tries to spend the rest of his life making Snoopy happy, but is eventually told by the principal to return to school, Charlie Brown tells Snoopy that he has to return to school and Snoopy replies \"Hey, No problem\" \"I was already happy\".\\nThe strip where Snoopy says \"Hey, No problem\" \"I was already happy\" from November 10, 1989.\\nSally Brown\\nSally does not care very much about Snoopy and often calls him a stupid beagle. Sally usually complains when Charlie Brown asks her to feed Snoopy whenever when he is away from home. While Sally was still an infant, she had a friendly and playful relationship with Snoopy. In later years Sally enlists Snoopy\\'s help with school assignments. She even treats him to an ice cream cone (a very tall ice cream cone, with scoops of about a dozen flavours) when Snoopy helps her get an \"A\" on a report about \"Our Animal Friends\". In one storyline, Sally uses Snoopy as a \"weapon\" to help protect her from bullies on the playground (Snoopy barks loudly at anyone who threatens Sally, leading Snoopy to comment, \"I feel like a can of mace!\"), but this ends in disaster when Snoopy sees an old girlfriend of his and runs off to meet her, abandoning Sally and leaving her to get \"slaughtered\" by the playground bullies.\\nLinus van Pelt\\nSnoopy and Linus appear have a good relationship, at least when Snoopy is fantasizing about being Joe Cool or the World Famous Attorney . In one strip from May 12, 1972 , where Lucy kicks Linus out of the house when their mother is in hospital. Joe Cool allows Linus to stay at his \"dorm\" (that is to say Snoopy\\'s doghouse ). Linus also offers Snoopy advice about legal issues whenever the beagle is playing the World Famous Attorney. For example, Sally Brown once physically injured Linus, resulting in Linus using Snoopy as his lawyer. However, they do have their quarrels, mainly over Snoopy\\'s desire to take Linus\\' security blanket for himself. A recurring gag in the strip involves Snoopy grabbing the blanket in his mouth and dragging Linus around to make him let go. Occasionally, Snoopy goes as far as to swing around the blanket, with Linus still attached to it, before letting it go, sending Linus flying through the air. As a result of this treatment, Linus often refuses to let Snoopy near him when he knows he is after his blanket. Many strips show Linus threatening to inflict physical harm on Snoopy. easily scaring him away into submission. Despite all this, Linus and Snoopy remain on friendly terms, most of the time.\\nLucy van Pelt\\nSnoopy frequently tries to kiss Lucy on the cheek and/or nose, Lucy is afraid of dog germs, thoroughly hates these actions, which occasionally results in Lucy injuring Snoopy. Despite their rivalry towards each other, both seem to care for one another, In one strip this is proved when Lucy admits \"You know there are times when you really bug me!, But I must admit there are also times when I feel like giving you a hug\" and proceeds to hug Snoopy, proving this even more, also in Snoopy, Come Home , She is sad to see Snoopy go and is (momentarily) glad when he comes back home.\\nRerun van Pelt\\nSnoopy first met Rerun on March 27, 1973 when Snoopy greets Rerun in his sandbox by licking his face, he then turns away, observing that Rerun \"tastes terrible\".\\nIn strips from the later years of Peanuts, Rerun repeatedly asks Charlie Brown if he can borrow Snoopy, as his mother will not let him have a dog of his own. Snoopy and Rerun are often seen together in later strips, playing card games, throwing and chasing balls and frolicking in the snow. Rerun, younger than the other children in the strip, even treats Snoopy as a confidant at times, sharing his anxieties and thoughts with the beagle, who often responds with exasperated or sarcastic thoughts.\\nWoodstock\\nWoodstock is Snoopy\\'s best friend and sidekick. In March 1966, when one of Snoopy\\'s bird friends made their nest on Snoopy\\'s stomach, The mother left the bird nest and did not come back, Snoopy took care of Woodstock and another bird who was born at the same time. Snoopy soon made Woodstock and the other bird fly away, but Woodstock had a lot of trouble flying and soon came back. The under talented bird stayed by Snoopy\\'s doghouse, while at first Snoopy was annoyed by his presence, he soon warmed to him. Soon after Woodstock was officially named on June 22, 1970, Snoopy and Woodstock have become very close friends.\\nWoodstock often works as Snoopy\\'s secretary, which was most noticeable when Snoopy was the Head Beagle, He also is his secretary when Snoopy is assuming the role of The World Famous Attorney , he has also worked as Snoopy\\'s mechanic when Snoopy is The World War I Flying Ace . Woodstock also caddies for Snoopy when he plays golf, he has played American football with Snoopy, usually Woodstock has the most trouble kicking the football and catching it, When Snoopy is playing as a helicopter, Woodstock is his pilot.\\nPeppermint Patty\\nPeppermint Patty liked Snoopy a lot when she used to think of him as \"the funny looking kid with the big nose\", She got excited whenever he kissed her, for instance, in There\\'s No Time for Love, Charlie Brown , when Snoopy kisses her, she tells him, \"You sure know how to show a girl a good time\". When Peppermint Patty learns on March 21, 1974 that Snoopy is not a human, she continues to like him, but not in the same way she used to. A storyline in which she uses him as a watch dog when her father is away, was adapted into the Special Snoopy\\'s Getting Married, Charlie Brown .\\nLila\\nLila was Snoopy\\'s owner before Charlie Brown. Snoopy visits her in the film\\xa0 Snoopy, Come Home \\xa0and struggles to decide whether to stay with Charlie Brown or go back to Lila. Lila eventually convinces him to leave Charlie Brown so he can live with her again. However, upon arriving at her residence, Snoopy is overjoyed to see a \"NO DOGS ALLOWED\" sign.
