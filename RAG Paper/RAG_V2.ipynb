On Jan. 3, 2000, the last Peanuts daily strip was published.\\nA Brief History of Charles Schulz\\'s \\'Peanuts\\' Comic Strip - TIME\\nFollow @TIME\\nWhen Alex Davis was 2 years old, he pointed to a drawing his father had done and exclaimed, \"Snoopy!\" The problem: his father was Jim Davis, the creator of Garfield, and the picture was of the cat he made famous. Charles Schulz\\'s black-and-white dog is so beloved, though, that a lasagna-loving cat can\\'t even compete. Saturday, Oct. 2, marks 60 years since Schulz\\'s first Peanuts strip hit newspapers. Since then, Snoopy, Charlie Brown and the gang have become the most recognizable cartoon characters in America \\x97 and have left an indelible mark on American culture.\\nYet leave it to the man behind Charlie Brown to experience disappointment before success. In 1947 Schulz started a cartoon feature called L\\'il Folks for the St. Paul Pioneer Press. It was a flop, never achieving a permanent spot in the paper. In 1950 he compiled his strips and sold the series to the United Features Syndicate, which changed its name to Peanuts. Schulz originally resisted the name change. \"I wanted to keep Li\\'I Folks,\" he told TIME in 1965. \"I wanted a strip with dignity and significance. Peanuts made it sound too insignificant.\"\\n(See the top 10 children\\'s books of 2009.)\\nThe first strip was printed on Oct. 2, 1950, and appeared in seven newspapers. In the strip, Charlie Brown walks by two friends, one of whom remarks, \"Well! Here comes \\'ol Charlie Brown! Good \\'ol Charlie Brown ... yes, sir! Good \\'ol Charlie Brown ... how I hate him!\" By the end of the decade, Peanuts had been picked up by hundreds of newspapers and had won Schulz a Reuben award, the highest honor given by the National Cartoonists Society.\\nSchulz\\'s Peanuts exploded during the 1960s, leaving its fingerprints on everything it touched. Charlie Brown and the gang even graced the cover of TIME in 1965. The influence didn\\'t go just one way, though \\x97 Peanuts evolved with the turbulent decade. After Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, fans pressed Schulz to include a black character; Franklin first appeared on July 31 of that year. Peppermint Patty, a multidimensional, sports-loving girl living in a single-parent household, made her debut in 1966. And Woodstock, Snoopy\\'s yellow, feathered companion, finally got his name in 1970. When asked why he named the bird after the music festival, Schulz simply replied, \"Why not?\"\\n(See the 100 best TV shows of all time.)\\nPeanuts triumphed off the printed page as well. In 1965 A Charlie Brown Christmas first aired, beginning a string of televised specials. Two later specials, You\\'re a Good Sport, Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, both took home Emmy awards. In 1967 Snoopy and friends hit the stage in an off-Broadway production, You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown, which ran for four years. It remains one of the most performed American musicals in history. Charlie Brown and Snoopy even went to the moon in 1969, after the Apollo X crew named their command and lunar modules after them. In later decades, Schulz\\'s work graced the Louvre and Carnegie Hall.\\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, Schulz had acquired a massive personal fortune. As he gave millions away to charity, he was frequently listed by Forbes magazine as one of the highest-paid entertainers in America, alongside Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson. He became the highest-paid and most widely read cartoonist of all time. By 1984, Peanuts had made the Guinness World Records after being syndicated to its 2,000th newspaper. Peanuts, which was read by 355 million people, raked in cash through newspaper licensing, book compilations, merchandising and endorsements.\\nSchulz\\'s health began to deteriorate in the 1990s. His hands developed a tremor, leaving his classic lines wobblier than usual. He suffered a stroke in November 1999 that impaired his vision, memory and motivation to draw. On Dec. 14, 1999, he announced his retirement. On Jan. 3, 2000, the last Peanuts daily strip was published. Schulz died of complications from colon cancer on Feb. 12, one day before his final Sunday strip hit the presses. He was 78. Schulz was posthumously given the Congressional Gold Medal, the body\\'s highest honor given to a civilian. To this day, kids around the world know and love Snoopy.', 'Peanuts - Peanuts Wiki - Wikia - Peanuts 1950s. The first Peanuts comic strip from ... The final original daily Peanuts comic strip was published on ... Snoopy\\'s Christmas\" and \"Snoopy for President\".\\nPeanuts | Peanuts Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia\\nCharles M. Schulz drawing Snoopy .\\nPeanuts is a syndicated daily and Sunday comic strip written and illustrated by Charles M. Schulz , which ran from October 2, 1950, to February 13, 2000 (the day after Schulz\\'s death). In total 17,897 different Peanuts strips were published. The strip was one of the most popular and influential in the history of the medium, and considered the most beloved comic strips of all time. It was \"arguably the longest story ever told by one human being,\\'\"\\' according to Professor Robert Thompson of Syracuse University. At its peak, Peanuts ran in over 2,600 newspapers, with a readership of 355 million in 75 countries, and was translated into 21 languages. It helped to cement the four-panel gag strip as the standard in the United States. Reprints of the strip are still syndicated and run in many newspapers.\\nIn addition, Peanuts achieved considerable success for its television specials, several of which, including A Charlie Brown Christmas and It\\'s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown won or were nominated for Emmys. The holiday specials remain quite popular to this day, and are currently broadcast on ABC in the United States during the appropriate season.\\nContents\\nPeanuts 1940s\\nFront cover of a collection of Li\\'l Folks comic strips.\\nPeanuts had its origin in Li\\'l Folks , a weekly panel comic that appeared in Schulz\\'s hometown paper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, from 1947 to 1950. He first used the name Charlie Brown for a character there, although he used the name on four different occasions in Li\\'l Folks for different boys. The series also featured a dog that looked a lot like Snoopy . In 1948, Schulz sold a cartoon to the Saturday Evening Post; seventeen single-panel cartoons by Schulz would be published there.\\nIn 1948, Schulz tried to have Li\\'l Folks syndicated through the Newspaper Enterprise Association. Schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but the deal fell through. Li\\'l Folks was dropped in 1949. The next year, Schulz approached the United Features Syndicate with his best work from Li\\'l Folks.\\nWhen his work was picked up by United Features Syndicate, they decided to run the new comic strip he had been working on. This strip was similar in spirit to the panel comic, but it had a set cast of characters, rather than different nameless little folk for each page. Unfortunately, the name Li\\'l Folks was too similar to the names of two other comics of the time: Al Capp\\'s Li\\'l Abner and a now-forgotten strip titled Little Folks. To avoid confusion, the syndicate settled on the name Peanuts, a title Schulz always disliked. In a 1987 interview, Schulz said of the title Peanuts: \"It\\'s totally ridiculous, has no meaning, is simply confusing, and has no dignity — and I think my humor has dignity\". The periodic collections of the strips in paperback book form typically had either \"Charlie Brown\" or \"Snoopy\" in the title, not \"Peanuts\", due to Schulz\\'s distaste for his strip\\'s title. The Sunday panels eventually typically read, Peanuts, featuring Good Ol\\' Charlie Brown .\\nPeanuts 1950s\\nThe first Peanuts comic strip from October 2, 1950.\\nPeanuts premiered on October 2, 1950 in seven newspapers nationwide: The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, The Minneapolis Tribune, The Allentown Call-Chronicle, The Bethlehem Globe-Times, The Denver Post and The Seattle Times. It began as a daily strip; its first Sunday strip appeared January 6, 1952, in the half page format, which was the only complete format for the entire life of the Sunday strip.\\nBy the end of the 1950s only eleven characters had beeen introduced, namely Charlie Brown , Shermy , Patty , Snoopy , Violet , Schroeder , Lucy , Linus , Pig-Pen , Charlotte Braun and Sally . There were no minor characters, except for Charlotte Braun, although she was not originally supposed to be one.\\nCharlotte Braun made a very limited number of appearances in the Peanuts strip.\\nBy the time the first Peanuts Sunday strip appeared, the dailies had been reduced from full page strips to a mere four panels. While this reduced the capacity for artistic expression, the shortage of space allowed Schulz to create a new style for the medium. Schulz made the decision to produce all aspects of the strip, from the script to the finished art and lettering, himself. Thus the strip was able to be presented with a unified tone, and Schulz was able to employ a minimalistic style. Backgrounds were generally eschewed, and when utilised Schulz\\'s frazzled lines imbued them with a fraught, psychological appearance. This style has been described by art critic John Carlin as forcing \"its readers to focus on subtle nuances rather than broad actions or sharp transitions.\"\\nWhile the strip in its early years resembles its later form, there are significant differences. The art was cleaner and sleeker, though simpler, with thicker lines and short, squat characters. For example, in these early strips, Charlie Brown\\'s famous round head is closer to the shape of a football. In fact, most of the kids were initially fairly round-headed.\\nPeanuts 1960s-1990s\\n\"5\", a Peanuts character introduced in 1963.\\nFranklin.\\nPeppermint Patty.\\nPeanuts is remarkable for its deft social commentary, especially compared with other strips appearing in the 1950s and early 1960s. Schulz did not explicitly address racial and gender equality issues so much as he assumed them to be self-evident in the first place. Peppermint Patty \\'s athletic skill and self-confidence is simply taken for granted, for example, as is Franklin \\'s presence in a racially-integrated school and neighborhood.\\nSchulz could throw barbs at any number of topics when he chose, though. Over the years he tackled everything from the Vietnam War to school dress codes to the \"new math\". One of his most prescient sequences came in 1963 when he added a little boy named \" 5 \" to the cast, whose sisters were named \"3\" and \"4\" , and whose father had changed the family surname to their ZIP Code to protest the way numbers were taking over people\\'s identities. In 1957, a strip in which Snoopy tossed Linus into the air, and boasted that he was the first dog ever to launch a human, parodied the hype associated with Sputnik 2\\'s launch of \"Laika\" the dog into space earlier that year. Another sequence lampooned Little Leagues and \"organized\" play, when all the neighborhood kids join snowman-building leagues and criticize Charlie Brown when he insists on building his own snowmen without leagues or coaches..\\nPeanuts touched on religious themes on many occasions, most notably in the classic television special A Charlie Brown Christmas in 1965, which features the character Linus van Pelt quoting the King James Version of the Bible (Luke 2:8-14) to explain to Charlie Brown \"what Christmas is all about.\" (In personal interviews, Schulz mentioned that Linus represented his spiritual side.)\\nPeanuts probably reached its peak in American pop-culture awareness between 1965 and 1980; this period was the heyday of the daily strip, and there were numerous animated specials and book collections. During the 1980s other strips rivaled Peanuts in popularity, most notably Doonesbury, Garfield, The Far Side, Bloom County, and Calvin and Hobbes. However, Schulz still had one of the highest circulations in daily newspapers.\\nThe daily Peanuts strips were formatted in a four-panel \"space saving\" format beginning in the 1950s, with a few very rare eight panel strips, that still fit into the four-panel mold. On June 16, 1975 ,\\xa0the panel format was shortened slightly horizontally, and\\xa0shortly after the lettering became larger to accommodate the shrinking format. In 1988, Schulz abandoned this strict format and started using the entire length of the strip, in part to combat the dwindling size of the comics page, and also to experiment. Most daily Peanuts strips in the 1990s were three-panel strips.\\nPeanuts 2000s\\nThe final original daily Peanuts comic strip was published on January 3, 2000. The strip consisted simply of Snoopy sitting at his typewriter in thought with a note from Schulz that read as follows:\\n“\\nDear Friends,\\nI have been fortunate to draw Charlie Brown and his friends for almost fifty years. It has been the fulfillment of my childhood ambition. Unfortunately, I am no longer able to maintain the schedule demanded by a daily comic strip, My family does not wish Peanuts to be continued by anyone else, therefore I am announcing my retirement. I have been grateful over the years for the loyalty of our editors and the wonderful support and love expressed to me by fans of the comic strip. Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy...how can I ever forget them...\\n”\\nAlthough the daily strips came to an end, six more original Sunday Peanuts strips had yet to be published. The final original Sunday strip was published in newspapers a day after Schulz\\'s death on February 12. The final Sunday strip included all of the text from the final daily strip, and the only drawing: that of Snoopy typing in the lower right corner. It also added several classic scenes of the Peanuts characters surrounding the text. Following its finish, many newspapers began reprinting older strips under the title Classic Peanuts. Though it no longer maintains the \"first billing\" in as many newspapers as it enjoyed for much of its original run, Peanuts remains one of the most popular and widely syndicated strips today.\\nCast of characters\\nSome well known Peanuts characters. From the left, Franklin , Woodstock , Lucy van Pelt , Snoopy , Linus van Pelt , Charlie Brown , Peppermint Patty and Sally Brown .\\nThe initial cast of Peanuts was small, featuring only Charlie Brown , Shermy , Patty (not to be confused with Peppermint Patty ), and a beagle, Snoopy .\\nThough the strip did not have a lead character at the onset, it soon began to focus on Charlie Brown , a character developed from some of the painful experiences of Schulz\\'s formative years. Charlie Brown\\'s main characteristic is either self-defeating stubbornness or admirable determined persistence to try his best against all odds: he can never win a ballgame, but continues playing baseball ; he can never fly a kite successfully, but continues trying to fly his kite. Though his inferiority complex was evident from the start, in the earliest strips he also got in his own jabs when verbally sparring with Patty and Shermy. Some early strips also involved romantic attractions between Charlie Brown and Patty or Violet (the next major character added to the strip).\\nAs the years went by, Shermy and Patty appeared less often and were demoted to supporting roles, while new major characters were introduced. Schroeder , Lucy , and her brother Linus debuted as very young children — Schroeder and Linus both in diapers and pre-verbal. Snoopy, who began as a more-or-less typical puppy, soon started to verbalize his thoughts via thought bubbles. Eventually he adopted other human characteristics, such as walking on his hind legs, reading books, using a typewriter, and participating in sports. He also grew from being a cute little puppy to a full-grown dog.\\nIn the 1960s, the strip began to focus more on Snoopy. Many of the strips from this point revolve around Snoopy\\'s active, Walter Mitty-like fantasy life, in which he imagined himself to be a World War I Flying Ace or a bestselling suspense novelist , to the bemusement and consternation of the other characters who sometimes wonder what he is doing but also at times participate. Snoopy eventually took on many more distinct personas over the course of the strip, notably college student \" Joe Cool \".\\nMarcie was introduced to Peanuts in 1971.\\nSchulz continued to introduce new characters into the strip, including a tomboyish, freckle-faced, shorts-and-sandals-wearing girl named Patricia Reichardt, better known as \" Peppermint Patty .\" \"Peppermint\" Patty is an assertive, athletic, but rather obtuse girl who shakes up Charlie Brown\\'s world by calling him \"Chuck,\" flirting with him, and giving him compliments he is not sure he deserves. She also brings in a new group of friends, including the strip\\'s first black character, Franklin , and Peppermint Patty\\'s bookish sidekick Marcie , who calls Peppermint Patty \"Sir\" and Charlie Brown \"Charles.\"\\nSeveral additional family members of the characters were also introduced: Charlie Brown\\'s younger sister Sally , who is fixated on Linus; Linus and Lucy\\'s younger brother Rerun ; and Spike , Snoopy\\'s desert-dwelling brother from Needles, California, who was apparently named for Schulz\\'s own childhood dog.\\xa0More of\\xa0 Snoopy\\'s siblings \\xa0were later introduced into the strip. \\xa0\\nFrieda , introduced to Peanuts in 1963.\\nOther notable characters include: Snoopy\\'s friend Woodstock , a bird whose chirping is represented in print as little black lines but is nevertheless clearly understood by Snoopy; Pig-Pen , the perpetually dirty boy who could raise a cloud of dust on a clean sidewalk or in a snowstorm; and Frieda , a girl proud of her \"naturally curly hair\", and who owned a cat named Faron , much to Snoopy\\'s chagrin.\\nPeanuts had several recurring characters who were actually absent from view. Some, such as the\\xa0 Great Pumpkin or the Red Baron , may or may not have been figments of the cast\\'s imaginations. Others were not imaginary, such as the Little Red-Haired Girl (Charlie Brown\\'s perennial dream girl), Joe Shlabotnik (Charlie Brown\\'s baseball hero),\\xa0 World War II a vicious cat who\\xa0terrifies his neighbor,\\xa0Snoopy, and Charlie Brown\\'s unnamed pencil pal . After some early anomalies, adult figures never appeared in the strip.\\nSchulz also added some fantastic elements, sometimes imbuing inanimate objects with sparks of life. Charlie Brown\\'s nemesis, the Kite-Eating Tree , is one example. Sally Brown\\'s school building , that expressed thoughts and feelings about the students (and the general business of being a brick building), is another. Linus\\' famous \" security blanket \" also displayed occasional signs of anthropomorphism.\\nAges of the Peanuts characters\\nCharlie Brown says that he is four years old in the strip from November 3, 1950 .\\nOver the course of their nearly fifty-year run, most of the characters did not age more than two years. An exception are the characters who were introduced as infants, caught up with the rest of the cast, then stopped. Rerun is unique in that he stopped aging in kindergarten. Linus was first mentioned in the strip as Lucy\\'s baby brother, on September 19, 1952 . He aged to around Charlie Brown\\'s age over the course of the first ten years, during which we see him learn to walk and talk with the help of Lucy and Charlie Brown . When Linus stops aging he is about a year or so younger than Charlie Brown. Charlie himself was four when the strip began, and aged over the next two decades until he settled in as an eight-year-old (after which he is consistently referred to as eight when any age is given). Sally remains two years younger than her older brother Charlie Brown, although Charlie Brown was already of school age in the strips when she was born and seen as a baby.\\nIn one strip, when Lucy declares that by the time a child is five years old, his personality is already pretty well established, Charlie Brown protests, \"But I\\'m already five! I\\'m more than five!\"\\nCharlie Brown says that he is six years old in the strip from November 17, 1957 .\\nThe characters, however, were not strictly defined by their literal ages. \"Were they children or adults? Or some kind of hybrid?\" wrote David Michaelis of Time magazine. Schulz distinguished his creations by \"fusing adult ideas with a world of small children.\" Michaelis continues:\\n“ Through his characters, \"[Schulz] brought... humor to taboo themes such as faith, intolerance, depression, loneliness, cruelty and despair. His characters were contemplative. They spoke with simplicity and force. They made smart observations about literature, art, classical music, theology, medicine, psychiatry, sports and the law.\" ”\\nIn other words, the cast of Peanuts transcended age, and are more broadly human.\\nCurrent events were sometimes a subject of the strip over the years. In a 1995 series, Sally mentions the Classic Comic Strip Characters series of stamps, which were released four years earlier, and a story about the Vietnam War ran for ten days in the 1960s. The passage of time, however, is negligible and incidental in Peanuts.\\nCritical acclaim\\nCharles M. Schulz receives his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at Knott\\'s Berry Farm , Buena Park, California in June 1996.\\nPeanuts is often regarded as one of the most influential and well-written comic strips of all time. Schulz received the National Cartoonist Society Humor Comic Strip Award for Peanuts in 1962, the Elzie Segar Award in 1980, the Reuben Award in 1955 and 1964, and the Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. A Charlie Brown Christmas won a Peabody Award and an Emmy; Peanuts cartoon specials have received a total of two Peabody Awards and four Emmys. For his work on the strip, Charles Schulz is credited with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and a place in the William Randolph Hearst Cartoon Hall of Fame. Peanuts was featured on the cover of Time magazine on April 9, 1965, with the accompanying article praising the strip as being \"the leader of a refreshing new breed that takes an unprecedented interest in the basics of life.\"\\nConsidered amongst the greatest comic strips of all time, Peanuts was declared second in a list of the greatest comics of the 20th century commissioned by The Comics Journal in 1999. Peanuts lost out to George Herriman\\'s Krazy Kat, a strip Schulz himself admired and accepted the positioning in good grace, to the point of agreeing with the result. In 2002 TV Guide declared Snoopy and Charlie Brown equal eighth in their list of \"Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\", published to commemorate their 50th anniversary.\\nCartoon tributes have appeared in other comic strips since Schulz\\'s death in 2000. In May of that year, many cartoonists included a reference to Peanuts in their own strips. Originally planned as a tribute to Schulz\\'s retirement, after his death that February it became a tribute to his life and career. Similarly, on 30 October 2005, several comic strips again included references to Peanuts, and specifically the It\\'s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown television special.\\nA series of statues were erected in St. Paul, Minnesota, Schulz\\'s hometown, which represented a different character each year. The \"Peanuts on Parade\" tribute began in 2001 with Snoopy statues, followed by Charlie Brown in 2002, Lucy in 2003, Linus in 2004, and Snoopy and Woodstock lying on top of Snoopy\\'s doghouse in 2005.\\nIn 2001, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors renamed the Sonoma County Airport, located a few miles northwest of Santa Rosa, California, the Charles M. Schulz Airport in his honor. The airport\\'s amusing logo features Snoopy in goggles and scarf, taking to the skies on top of his red doghouse. A bronze statue of Charlie Brown and Snoopy stands in Depot Park in downtown Santa Rosa.\\nSchulz himself was included in the touring exhibition \"Masters of American Comics\" based on his achievements in the artform whilst producing the strip. His gag work is hailed as being \"psychologically complex\", and his style on the strip is noted as being \"perfectly in keeping with the style of its times.\"\\nTelevision and film productions\\nShermy in the first Peanuts animated television special, A Charlie Brown Christmas .\\nIn addition to the strip and numerous books, the Peanuts characters have appeared in animated form on television numerous times. This started when the Ford Motor Company licensed the characters in 1961 for a series of black and white television commercials for the Ford Falcon. The ads were animated by Bill Melendez for Playhouse Pictures, a cartoon studio that had Ford as a client. Schulz and Melendez became friends, and when producer Lee Mendelson decided to make a two-minute animated sequence for a TV documentary called A Boy Named Charlie Brown in 1963, he brought on Melendez for the project. Before the documentary was completed, the three of them (with help from their sponsor, the Coca-Cola Company ) produced their first half-hour animated special, the Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning A Charlie Brown Christmas , which was first aired on the CBS network on 9 December 1965.\\nThe animated version of Peanuts differs in some aspects from the strip. In the strip, adult voices are heard by the characters but conversations are usually only depicted from the children\\'s end. To translate this aspect to the animated medium, Melendez famously used the sound of a trombone with a plunger mute opening and closing on the bell to simulate adult \"voices\". A more significant deviation from the strip was the treatment of Snoopy . In the strip, the dog\\'s thoughts are verbalized in thought balloons; in animation, he is typically mute, his thoughts communicated through growls, laughs or an un-canine like chirping sound (voiced by Bill Melendez), and pantomime, or by having human characters verbalizing his thoughts for him. These treatments have both been abandoned temporarily in the past. For example, they experimented with teacher dialogue in She\\'s a Good Skate, Charlie Brown . The elimination of Snoopy\\'s \"voice\" is probably the most controversial aspect of the adaptations, but Schulz apparently approved of the treatment. (Snoopy\\'s thoughts were conveyed in voiceover for the first time in animation in the animated version of the Broadway musical You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown , and later on occasion in the animated series The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show .)\\nMelendez had some initial concerns about animating the Peanuts character the way Schulz designed them. They are limited in terms of mobility, for example, arms could only be raised so far. Melendez did not want to compromise the integrity of Schulz\\'s work, and found creative ways of resolving problems presented by their design.\\nTitle card for It\\'s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.\\nThe success of A Charlie Brown Christmas was the impetus for CBS to air many more prime-time Peanuts. specials over the years, beginning with Charlie Brown\\'s All-Stars and It\\'s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown in 1966. In total, more than thirty animated specials were produced. Until his death in 1976, jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi composed highly acclaimed musical scores for the specials; in particular, the piece \" Linus and Lucy \" which has become popularly known as the signature theme song of the Peanuts franchise.\\nIn addition to Coca-Cola, other companies that sponsored Peanuts specials over the years included Dolly Madison cakes , Kellogg\\'s, McDonald\\'s , Peter Paul-Cadbury candy bars, General Mills, and Nabisco.\\nSchulz, Mendelson, and Melendez also collaborated on four theatrical feature films starring the characters, the first of which was A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969). Most of these made use of material from Schulz\\'s strips, which were then adapted, although in other cases plots were developed around areas where there were minimal strips to reference. Such was also the case with The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show , a Saturday-morning TV series which debuted on CBS in 1983 and lasted for three seasons.\\nHappy New Year, Charlie Brown! is an animated TV special based on Peanuts that first aired in 1986.\\nBy the late-1980s, the specials\\' popularity had begun to wane, and CBS sometimes rejected a few specials. An eight-episode TV miniseries called This is America, Charlie Brown , for instance, was released during a writer\\'s strike. Eventually, the last Peanuts specials were released direct-to-video, and no new ones were created until after the year 2000 when ABC obtained the rights to the three fall holiday specials. The Nickelodeon cable network re-aired the bulk of the specials, as well as The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show, for a time in the late 1990s under the umbrella title You\\'re On Nickelodeon, Charlie Brown. Many of the specials and feature films have also been released on various home video formats over the years.\\nEight Peanuts-based specials have been made after Shulz\\'s death. Of these, three are tributes to Peanuts or previous Peanuts animated specials, and five are completely new specials based on dialogue from the strips, and ideas given to ABC by Schulz before his death. He\\'s a Bully, Charlie Brown , was telecast on ABC on November 20, 2006, following a repeat broadcast of A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving . Airing forty-one years after the first special, the premiere of He\\'s a Bully, Charlie Brown was watched by nearly ten million viewers, winning its time slot and beating a Madonna concert special.\\nTheatrical productions\\nPoster for the 1971 Broadway production of You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown.\\nThe Peanuts characters even found their way to the live stage, appearing in the musicals You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown and Snoopy!!! The Musical , and in Snoopy on Ice, a live Ice Capades-style show aimed primarily at young children, all of which have had several touring productions over the years.\\nYou\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown was originally an extremely successful off-Broadway musical that ran for four years (1967-1971) in New York City and on tour, with Gary Burghoff as the original Charlie Brown. An updated revival opened on Broadway in 1999, and by 2002 it had become the most frequently produced musical in American theater history. It was also adapted for television twice, as a live-action NBC special and an animated CBS special .\\nSnoopy!!! The Musical was a musical comedy based on the Peanuts comic strip, originally performed at Lamb\\'s Theatre off-Broadway in 1982. In its 1983 run in London\\'s West End, it won an Olivier Award. In 1988, it was adapted into an animated TV special . The New Players Theatre in London staged a revival in 2004 to honor its 21st anniversary, but some reviewers noted that its \"feel good\" sentiments had not aged well.\\nRecord albums\\nVince Guaraldi.\\nIn 1962, Columbia Records issued an album titled Peanuts, with Kaye Ballard and Arthur Siegel performing (as Lucy and Charlie Brown , respectively) to music composed by Fred Karlin.\\nFantasy Records issued several albums featuring Vince Guaraldi \\'s jazz scores from the animated specials, including Jazz Impressions of a Boy Named Charlie Brown (1964), A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965), Oh, Good Grief! (1968), and Charlie Brown\\'s Holiday Hits (1998). All were later reissued on CD.\\nOther jazz artists have recorded Peanuts-themed albums, often featuring cover versions of Guaraldi\\'s compositions. These include Ellis Marsalis, Jr. and Wynton Marsalis (Joe Cool\\'s Blues, 1995); George Winston (Linus & Lucy, 1996); David Benoit (Here\\'s to You, Charlie Brown!, 2000); and Cyrus Chestnut (A Charlie Brown Christmas, 2000).\\nCast recordings (in both original and revival productions) of the stage musicals You\\'re a Good Man, Charlie Brown and Snoopy!!! The Musical have been released over the years.\\nNumerous animated Peanuts specials were adapted into book-and-record sets, issued on the \"Charlie Brown Records\" label by Disney Read-Along in the 1970s and \\'80s.\\nOther licensed appearances and merchandise\\nSnoopy the World War I Flying Ace on the MetLife blimp.\\nOver the years, the Peanuts characters have appeared in advertisements for Dolly Madison snack cakes, Friendly\\'s restaurants, A&W Root Beer, Cheerios breakfast cereal, and Ford automobiles. \"Pig-Pen\" appeared in a memorable spot for Regina vacuum cleaners.\\nThey are currently spokespeople in print and television advertisements for the MetLife insurance company. MetLife usually uses Snoopy in its advertisements as opposed to other characters: for instance, the MetLife blimps are named \"Snoopy One\" and \"Snoopy Two\" and feature him in his World War I Flying Ace persona.\\nThe characters have been featured on Hallmark Cards since 1960, and can be found adorning clothing, figurines, plush dolls, flags, balloons, posters, Christmas ornaments, and countless other bits of licensed merchandise.\\nThe Apollo 10 lunar module was nicknamed \"Snoopy\" and the command module \"Charlie Brown\". While not included in the official mission logo, Charlie Brown and Snoopy became semi-official mascots for the mission. Schulz also drew some special mission-related artwork for NASA , and at least one regular strip related to the mission, where Charlie Brown consoles Snoopy about how the spacecraft named after him was left in lunar orbit.\\nThe 1960s pop band, The Royal Guardsmen , released several Snoopy-themed albums and singles, including their debut album in 1966 featuring the song \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron \", which made it to number two on request charts. The band followed with several other Snoopy-themed songs, but they did not do as well: \"The Return of the Red Baron\", \"Snoopy and His Friends\",\" Snoopy\\'s Christmas\" and \"Snoopy for President\". Many of these featured cover art by Charles Schulz.\\nIn the 1960s, Robert L. Short interpreted certain themes and conversations in Peanuts as being consistent with parts of Christian theology, and used them as illustrations during his lectures about the gospel, and as source material for several books, as he explained in his bestselling paperback book, The Gospel According to Peanuts.\\nIn 1980, Charles Schulz was introduced to artist Tom Everhart during a collaborative art project. Everhart became fascinated with Schulz\\'s art style and worked Peanuts themed art into his own work. Schulz encouraged Everhart to continue with his work. Everhart continues to be the only artist authorized to paint Peanuts characters.\\nGiant helium balloons of Charlie Brown and Snoopy have long been a feature in the annual Macy\\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.\\nThe characters were licensed for use in 1992 as atmosphere for the national amusement park chain Cedar Fair.The images of the Peanuts characters are used frequently, most visibly in several versions of the logo for flagship park, Cedar Point. Knott\\'s Berry Farm, which was later acquired by Cedar Fair, was the first theme park to make Snoopy its mascot. Cedar Fair also operated Camp Snoopy , an indoor amusement park in the Mall of America until the mall took over its operation as of March 2005, renaming it The Park at MOA, and no longer using the Peanuts characters as its theme.\\nThe Peanuts characters have been licenced to Universal Studios Japan. Peanuts merchandise in Japan has been licensed by Sanrio, best known for Hello Kitty.\\nPeanuts characters at the Snoopy\\'s World theme park in New Town Plaza, Sha Tin, Hong Kong.\\nIn New Town Plaza, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, there is a mini theme park dedicated to Snoopy.\\nThe Peanuts gang have also appeared in video games, such as Snoopy in a 1984 by Radarsoft, Snoopy Tennis (Game Boy Color), and in October 2006, Snoopy vs. the Red Baron by Namco Bandai. Many Peanuts characters have cameos in the latter game, including Woodstock , Charlie Brown , Linus , Lucy , Marcie and Sally .\\nPeanuts has also been involved with NASCAR. In 2000, Jeff Gordon drove his #24 Chevrolet with a Snoopy -themed motif at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Two years later, Tony Stewart drove a #20 Great Pumpkin motif scheme for two races. The first, at Bristol Motor Speedway, featured a black car with Linus sitting in a pumpkin field. Later, at Atlanta Motor Speedway, Tony drove an orange car featuring the Peanuts characters trick-or-treating. Most recently, Bill Elliott drove a #6 Dodge with an A Charlie Brown Christmas scheme. That car ran at the 2005 NASCAR BUSCH Series race at Memphis Motorsports Park..\\nIn April of 2002 The Peanuts Collectors Edition Monopoly board was released by USAopoly. The game was created by Justin Gage, a prolific collector and friend of Charles and Jeannie Schulz. The game was dedicated to Schulz in memory of his passing.\\nWhen asked whether he felt that licensing threatened to \"commercialize\" the strip, Schulz said that would be impossible, because comic strips were already a commercial product, designed to sell newspapers. \"How can a commercial product be accused of turning commercial?\" He also did not feel licensing cheapened the artistic integrity of Peanuts. Comic strips, he said, are not a \"pure art form, by any means.\"\\nBooks\\nCover of the 2001 book Peanuts: The Art of Charles Schulz\\nThe Peanuts characters have been featured in many books over the years. Some represented chronological reprints of the newspaper strip, while others were thematic collections, such as Snoopy\\'s Tennis Book. Some single-story books were produced, such as Snoopy and the Red Baron. In addition, most of the animated television specials and feature films were adapted into book form.\\nCharles Schulz always resisted publication of early Peanuts strips, as they did not reflect the characters as he eventually developed them. However, in 1997 he began talks with Fantagraphics Books to have the entire run of the strip, almost 18,000 cartoons, published chronologically in book form. The first volume in the collection, The Complete Peanuts \\': 1950 to 1952, was published in April 2004. Peanuts is in a unique situation compared to other comics in that archive quality masters of most strips are still owned by the syndicate. All strips, including Sundays, are in black and white.\\nThe books, like the strips themselves, continue to be issued on an ongoing basis, proof that Peanuts, even after more than sixty years, still continues to resonate with readers of all ages.', '20 Things You Didn\\'t Know About Charles Schulz - ... first appeared in an earlier cartoon written by the ... Schulz\\'s Peanuts comic strip was published in 75 ... 20 Things You Didn\\'t Know About ...\\n20 Things You Didn\\'t Know About Charles Schulz | The Huffington Post\\n20 Things You Didn\\'t Know About Charles Schulz\\n11/26/2013 08:34 am ET | Updated Oct 19, 2016\\n2k\\nABC Photo Archives via Getty Images\\nToday is the birthday of American cartoonist Charles Monroe Schulz, that beloved \"Peanuts\" creator who would turn 91 years old if he were still alive today.\\nBorn in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Schulz is remembered most fondly for the wholesome characters he created throughout his 50-year-long illustration career. Among them are the eternally hesitant Charlie Brown and the mischievous Snoopy, two characters who came to represent the iconic four-panel gag strip known as \"Peanuts.\" Schulz devoted much of his life to the American comic standard, which ran up until the day after his death in 2000.\\nIn honor of the 91st anniversary of Schulz\\'s birth, we wanted to shine a spotlight on the man behind the cartoon, so we\\'ve put together 20 facts you might not have known about the great American artist. Behold, the quirks of a \"Peanuts\" legend:\\n1. The man, Charles Schulz, and the comic character, Charlie Brown, are pretty similar.\\nSchulz\\'s father was a barber and his mother a housewife, just like Charlie Brown\\'s parents. Plus, as the youngest in his class at Central High School in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Schulz was famously shy.\\n2. Schulz\\'s childhood nickname was based on a comic strip.\\nSchulz\\'s childhood nickname, Sparky, was given to him by his uncle and refers to the horse Spark Plug in Billy DeBeck\\'s comic strip, \"Barney Google .\"\\n3. Schulz had his own unusual dog named Spike.\\nWhen Schulz was a young boy, he submitted a picture of his dog, Spike, to Ripley\\'s Believe It or Not! His drawing appeared in Robert Ripley\\'s syndicated panel, describing Spike as an unusual dog who ate pins, tacks and razor blades.\\n4. Schulz served in WWII but never fired his weapon.\\nIn 1943, Schulz was drafted into the United States Army where he served as a staff sergeant with the 20th Armored Division in Europe. During his service as a squad leader on a .50 caliber machine gun team, his unit saw very little combat, and Schulz later explained that during the only opportunity to fire his machine gun he discovered that he had actually forgotten to load it.\\n5. Schulz debuted his two most famous characters in a comic strip known as \"Li\\'l Folks.\"\\nThe name of Schulz\\'s most famous character -- Charlie Brown -- first appeared in an earlier cartoon written by the Peanuts creator titled \"Li\\'l Folks\" , which was published from 1947 to 1950. That same series also featured a dog that resembled Snoopy.\\n6. Schulz didn\\'t actually name \"Peanuts.\"\\nIn 1950, Schulz approached the United Feature Syndicate with his comic strip Li\\'l Folks. The syndication company accepted Schulz work but decided that the name \"Li\\'l Folks\" was too close to the names of two other comics of the time: Al Capp\\'s \"Li\\'l Abner\" and a strip titled \"Little Folks.\" So, to avoid confusion, United Feature Syndicate settled on the name \"Peanuts\" after the peanut gallery featured in the \"Howdy Doody\" TV show. In the end, Schulz did not name his famous work.\\n7. And he hated the name.\\nSchulz always disliked the title of his famous comic strip, \"Peanuts\". In a 1987 interview , Schulz said of the name: \"It\\'s totally ridiculous, has no meaning, is simply confusing, and has no dignity -- and I think my humor has dignity.\"\\n8. Schulz wanted to call Snoopy \"Sniffy.\"\\nSchulz was originally going to call his star dog character \" Sniffy\" , that is until he discovered that name had already been used in a different comic strip. So the cartoonist changed it to \"Snoopy\" after remembering that his late mother Dena Schulz told the family that if they were ever to acquire a third dog, it should be called Snoopy, an affectionate term in Norwegian. (The word is \"Snuppa\".)\\n9. And Schulz wanted Snoopy to be entirely silent.\\nSchulz originally imagined Snoopy as a silent character. It was only after two years of the comic that Snoopy verbalized his thoughts to readers in a thought balloon in 1952.\\n10. Schulz named many of the other \"Peanuts\" characters after his friends.\\nLinus and Shermy , prominent characters in the Peanuts comic strip, were named for good friends of Schulz, Linus Maurer and Sherman Plepler.\\n11. Relatives served as inspiration too.\\nThe character of Peppermint Patty was inspired by Patricia Swanson, one of Schulz\\'s cousins on his mother\\'s side. Schulz came up with the full name when he saw peppermint candies in his house.\\n12. And ex-girlfriends.\\nThe character of the Little Red-Haired Girl (Charlie Brown\\'s love interest in \"Peanuts\") was based on a woman in Schulz\\'s life named Donna Mae Johnson. She was an Art Instruction Inc. accountant with whom the cartoonist had a relationship, but when he proposed to her, she turned him down.\\n13. Schulz was adamant about \"A Charlie Brown Christmas.\"\\nFor \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\", network executives were hesitant about a scene involving Linus reciting the story of Christ\\'s birth. But in a documentary about the making of the program , Charles Schulz asks, \"If we don\\'t do it, who will?\" And so the scene remained. Schulz also felt strongly about the absence of a laugh track in the televised cartoon, maintaining that the audience should be able to enjoy the show at their own pace, without being cued when to laugh. CBS created a version with a laugh track, but that version never aired.\\n15. Schulz was an avid hockey fan.\\nSchulz was an avid hockey fan. In 1998, he hosted the first Over 75 Hockey Tournament and in 2001, and in 2001, Ramsey County renamed the Highland Park Ice Arena in St. Paul, Minn., the Charles M. Schulz Highland Arena in his honor.\\n16. Schulz loved the Space Program.\\nSchulz was also a huge proponent of the space program, so much so that the 1969 Apollo 10 command module was named Charlie Brown and a lunar module was named Snoopy.\\n17. Schulz was pals with Reagan.\\nRonald Reagan once wrote a fan note to Schulz saying that the president identified with Charlie Brown.\\n18. Schulz really wanted Charlie Brown to kick the football.\\nWhen Schulz was asked if Charlie Brown would finally get to kick the football in the final \"Peanuts\" strip, his response was: \"Oh, no! Definitely not! I couldn\\'t have Charlie Brown kick that football; that would be a terrible disservice to him after nearly half a century.\" But in a December 1999 interview , Schulz recounted the moment when he signed the final comic panel, stating, “All of a sudden I thought, \\'You know, that poor, poor kid, he never even got to kick the football. What a dirty trick -- he never had a chance to kick the football!\\'”\\n18. Schulz was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame.']\n",

      "When Alex Davis was 2 years old, he pointed to a drawing his father had done and exclaimed, \"Snoopy!\" The problem: his father was Jim Davis, the creator of Garfield, and the picture was of the cat he made famous. Charles Schulz's black-and-white dog is so beloved, though, that a lasagna-loving cat can't even compete. Saturday, Oct. 2, marks 60 years since Schulz's first Peanuts strip hit newspapers. Since then, Snoopy, Charlie Brown and the gang have become the most recognizable cartoon characters in America  and have left an indelible mark on American culture.\n",
      "Yet leave it to the man behind Charlie Brown to experience disappointment before success. In 1947 Schulz started a cartoon feature called L'il Folks for the St. Paul Pioneer Press. It was a flop, never achieving a permanent spot in the paper. In 1950 he compiled his strips and sold the series to the United Features Syndicate, which changed its name to Peanuts. Schulz originally resisted the name change. \"I wanted to keep Li'I Folks,\" he told TIME in 1965. \"I wanted a strip with dignity and significance. Peanuts made it sound too insignificant.\"\n",
      "(See the top 10 children's books of 2009.)\n",
      "The first strip was printed on Oct. 2, 1950, and appeared in seven newspapers. In the strip, Charlie Brown walks by two friends, one of whom remarks, \"Well! Here comes 'ol Charlie Brown! Good 'ol Charlie Brown ... yes, sir! Good 'ol Charlie Brown ... how I hate him!\" By the end of the decade, Peanuts had been picked up by hundreds of newspapers and had won Schulz a Reuben award, the highest honor given by the National Cartoonists Society.\n",
      "Schulz's Peanuts exploded during the 1960s, leaving its fingerprints on everything it touched. Charlie Brown and the gang even graced the cover of TIME in 1965. The influence didn't go just one way, though  Peanuts evolved with the turbulent decade. After Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, fans pressed Schulz to include a black character; Franklin first appeared on July 31 of that year. Peppermint Patty, a multidimensional, sports-loving girl living in a single-parent household, made her debut in 1966. And Woodstock, Snoopy's yellow, feathered companion, finally got his name in 1970. When asked why he named the bird after the music festival, Schulz simply replied, \"Why not?\"\n",
      "(See the 100 best TV shows of all time.)\n",
      "Peanuts triumphed off the printed page as well. In 1965 A Charlie Brown Christmas first aired, beginning a string of televised specials. Two later specials, You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, both took home Emmy awards. In 1967 Snoopy and friends hit the stage in an off-Broadway production, You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown, which ran for four years. It remains one of the most performed American musicals in history. Charlie Brown and Snoopy even went to the moon in 1969, after the Apollo X crew named their command and lunar modules after them. In later decades, Schulz's work graced the Louvre and Carnegie Hall.\n",
      "By the 1980s and 1990s, Schulz had acquired a massive personal fortune. As he gave millions away to charity, he was frequently listed by Forbes magazine as one of the highest-paid entertainers in America, alongside Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson. He became the highest-paid and most widely read cartoonist of all time. By 1984, Peanuts had made the Guinness World Records after being syndicated to its 2,000th newspaper. Peanuts, which was read by 355 million people, raked in cash through newspaper licensing, book compilations, merchandising and endorsements.\n",
      "Schulz's health began to deteriorate in the 1990s. His hands developed a tremor, leaving his classic lines wobblier than usual. He suffered a stroke in November 1999 that impaired his vision, memory and motivation to draw. On Dec. 14, 1999, he announced his retirement. On Jan. 3, 2000, the last Peanuts daily strip was published. Schulz died of complications from colon cancer on Feb. 12, one day before his final Sunday strip hit the presses. He was 78. Schulz was posthumously given the Congressional Gold Medal, the body's highest honor given to a civilian. To this day, kids around the world know and love Snoopy.\n"
